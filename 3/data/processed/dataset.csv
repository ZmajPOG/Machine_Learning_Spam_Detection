"Sara, As in our past exercises for the ""Non-Terminated/In-the-Money"" Counterparties, the Thiele-Kaolin Company continues to appear as a ""financial"" trading relationship.

"I am changing the way the curve is generated starting in Jan 2004 to better replicate seasonal fundamentals. There are convincing arguments as to why the summer/winter spreads should tighten over time. However, in the previous methodology they blew out. For instance summer/winter in Cal 3 was .232 while Cal 10 was .256. I have added a seasonality dampening function that both contracts the summer/winter spread and applies a premium to the electric load demand months of July and August over time. The formula for the curve remains the same except for a premium lookup for the month as well as for the year. These premiums are as follows: Jan -.008 Feb -.004 Mar -.001 Apr .002 May .003 Jun .004 Jul .004 Aug .004 Sep .003 Oct .002 Nov -.003 Dec -.006 These premiums start in Jan 2004 On Wednesday Jan 2003 settled 2.959, the 3/4 spread was marked at .0375, the 4/5 spread was marked at .0475. In the old methodology Jan 2003 = 2.959 Jan 2004 = 2.959 + .0375 = 2.9965 Jan 2005 = 2.9965 + .0475 = 3.044 In the new methodology Jan 2003 = 2.959 Jan 2004 = 2.959 + .0375 - .008 =2.9885 Jan 2005 = 2.9885 + .0475 -.008 = 3.028 The only change in the formula is from: Month x = Month (x- 1 year) + lookup on year on year table to Month x = Month (x- 1 year) + lookup on year on year table + lookup on month premium table The seasonality premiums will change over time and I will let you know when I change them",ham

For a sneak preview, check out the photo of the day at www.telluride-ski.com/dayphoto.html. BARGAINS & DEALS The best-case scenario for skiing Telluride is to live here.

With that in mind, the Telluride Ski Resort installed a new snowmaking system this summer that guarantees that every lift pod will have coverage on at least one run all season long! Yep. Lifts 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9 will have better conditions for riding and skiing from beginning to end. As the hipper folks say, the turns will be &tasty.8 The tastiest new addition to the mountain, however, is Allred,s, a new 140-seat restaurant that is guaranteed to delight even the most discriminating diners. Located mid-mountain at the gondola Station St. Sophia, Allred,s will serve as a private club by day in the winter, an upscale lunch spot in the summer and a fine dining experience in the evenings year-round. More on this epicurean dream in later e-rides. For dinner reservations, call 970-728-7474. One other great new thing: It,s easier to get to Telluride than ever before. You can now fly to Montrose EVERY DAY from Dallas/Ft. Worth on American Airlines*but the flight will only have 129 seats, so be sure your body is in one of them! WHAT,S HAPPENING Of course the most important thing on the Telluride calendar is November 22, the Official Opening Day. But there are other things worth mentioning. Like the Sneak Preview of the mountain on November 21. For one day only you can ski Telluride for $20, and all proceeds go to the Telluride Ski and Snowboard Club. After the Donation Day, you can still get good deals. From November 21 through December 16, Telluride hosts its annual Ski Free & More program. What, s it entail? Exactly what it says. Skiers and riders staying at participating lodges in the towns of Telluride and Mountain Village can choose a free lift ticket, a free ski clinic, a free lunch or a free half-day of childcare for each night they stay. For more information call 888-288-7360. And if you,re looking forward to having a ball, why not do it right at the annual Black & White Affair? On November 25, the Telluride Ski and Snowboard Club hosts this gala event at the luxurious Telluride Conference Center. Dress up and dance off your turkey. No one puts on a ball like Telluride! SLICE OF LIFE Imagine being over 50 years old and never having seen any snow! Such was the case for my friend Sarah, who recently moved to Telluride from the Caribbean. She and her daughters arrived late this summer, and when the snows began to fall a few weeks ago, they were in rapture! Sarah ran outside and began to dance around (to her 17-year-old daughter,s absolute embarrassment!) However, the daughters both caught the enthusiasm and built their first snowman ever. The snowman , of course, had a perfect carrot nose.. An organic carrot, no less. Hey, this is Telluride. Only the best for our snowmen. AND SO, E-RIDERS, That,s all for this letter. Hope you,re planning your trip to Telluride, where the snow is always whiter and the lines are always short. See you on the slopes! Rosemerry WHO,S WRITING THIS ANYWAY? Against her will, Rosemerry Wahtola Trommer learned to ski in Telluride six years ago. But after a few turns, she fell ( in love with the sport. She lives with her husband and cat at the base of Lift 7*an ideal spot for getting first chair of the morning.",ham

Latest NFL Player News Ron Dixon , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 With the injury to Joe Jurevicius, Dixon will take over as the Giants' third down receiver. He has no Fantasy value. Joe Jurevicius , WR NYG - Fear Updated 12/12/00 An MRI performed on Monday revealed a sprained medial collateral ligament in Jurevicius' left knee. Head Coach Jim Fassel says that Jurevicus is expected to be sidelined for at least three to four weeks. Ron Dixon will take over as the Giants' third down receiver. At this point, neither player has any real Fantasy value. Cowboys , DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 The Cowboys' defensive line played its best games of the season, sacking Redskins' quarterback Jeff George five times while limiting Stephen Davis to only 57 yards rushing. Dallas' unit, which has been ravaged by injuries, held the 'Skins to only 13 points on the afternoon and looked much more like a cohesive unit than in recent weeks. Expect the Cowboys to follow up this effort with another solid performance against the Giants, but look long and hard before giving Dallas' D the start this week. Brad Johnson , QB WAS - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/12/00 With the announcement that Jeff George will remain Washington's starter for the last two games, Johnson's season and Fantasy value is all but gone. Don't be surprised to see Johnson in a new uniform come training camp. Brian Griese , QB DEN - The Rounders Updated 12/11/00 Griese is expected to play in the Broncos' regular-season finale. Coach Mike Shanahan said Monday that Griese has a ""realistic chance"" of returning to the lineup against San Francisco on Dec. 23. Fantasy owners should look elsehwere for a Fantasy QB. Griese hasn't played in almost a month. A player with such a layoff is a high-risk for your Fantasy team. Jackie Harris , TE DAL - The Snake Pit Updated 12/11/00 Harris caught only two passes for 20 yards against Washington, numbers that have more or less become his norm this season. He is far too inconsistent to be considered a starter, so avoid playing Harris if at all possible. Irving Fryar , WR WAS - The Snake Pit Updated 12/11/00 Since Albert Connell's playing time has been limited due to injury, Fryar has posted decent numbers for the 'Skins. He caught three passes for 56 yards and a touchdown against Dallas, and now has a score in three of his last four games. Although he isn't a solid starter, Fryar could still be useful to Fantasy owners in deeper leagues. Bobby Shaw , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 Shaw led the Steelers with 88 yards on six receptions, with one of them going for a touchdown. However, his performance was deceiving, as he also dropped two other key passes. Keep that in mind as he prepares to go up against Washington next Sunday, as the Steelers might not go to him as much as a result. James Thrash , WR WAS - The Lie Downs Updated 12/11/00 Thrash caught five passes for 62 yards in Washington's 32-13 loss to the Cowboys on Sunday. Thrash has been Jeff George's favorite target this season, so he is an interesting commodity at this point in the season. If your league uses three starting wideouts, considering making Thrash your number three man. Will Blackwell , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 Blackwell made his first two catches, which went for 23 yards total, in more than a year during Sunday's game against the Giants. He played two games prior without a reception after missing the first 11 games of the season by being on the physically unable to perform list after knee surgery. Don't take this as a sign of things to come for Blackwell; he's a marginal receiver over the final two games. Wane McGarity , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 McGarity was held without a catch but scored on reverse in Dallas' 32-13 win over Washington. He has no Fantasy value at this point of the season. Jason Tucker , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 Tucker was held without a catch against the Redskins on Sunday, but did run a 17-yard reverse for a touchdown. The young Dallas receiver has no Fantasy value at this point in the season. Kris Brown , K PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 Brown missed two field goals during Sunday's game against the Giants. He missed tries from 36 and 44 yards out, marking the first time in his two-year career that he has missed multiple field goal attempts in one game. Don't start Brown during your Fantasy playoffs. Albert Connell , WR WAS - FDIC Updated 12/11/00 Connell was held without a catch in minimal playing time against the Cowboys. He has only 13 catches in his last six games, and is still being bothered by a knee injury. Avoid starting Connell at this crucial point in your Fantasy season. Anthony Johnson , RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 Johnson suffered a sprained toe late in Sunday's game against Arizona. He rushed for 39 yards on 13 carries after relieving Fred Taylor. Johnson was walking with a limp after the game and is unsure whether he will be able to play next Sunday against Cincinnati. James McKnight , WR DAL - The Lie Downs Updated 12/11/00 McKnight was the only Dallas wideout to catch a pass on Sunday, hauling in two balls for 58 yards against the Redskins. With the Cowboys' quarterback situation up in the air, avoiding all of Dallas' receivers is a good idea. R.Jay Soward , WR JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 The Jaguars suspended Soward for Sunday's game against Arizona, and several team sources said it was due to his missing a team meeting. He has made several similar violations and was demoted to the No. 3 receiver during a October 22 loss. Don't count on any Fantasy numbers from Soward the remainder of the season. Larry Centers , RB WAS - The Fat Bastards Updated 12/11/00 In his typical role out of the backfield, Centers caught five passes for 54 yards in Sunday's loss to the Cowboys. At this point in the season, Centers' Fantasy value is minimal at best, so starting him now is a huge risk. Jaguars , DT JAC - The Snake Pit Updated 12/11/00 Jacksonville's defense posted a solid outing Sunday against Arizona, allowing just 10 points and 189 net yards. Brant Boyer helped lead the Jaguars' D to an interception and four sacks on the day. The performance by this unit has been among the league's best in recent weeks, despite a rash of injuries. We expect more solid numbers as Jacksonville takes on Cincinnati next week, so look to this unit during your playoffs. Michael Wiley , RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 In his first game as Dallas' third down back, Wiley ran for 38 yards on 11 carries. The rookie from Ohio State will see more playing time in the weeks to come, but doesn't have any Fantasy value at this point. Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Meximullets Updated 12/11/00 Davis had a surprisingly modest game against the Cowboys this week, rushing for only 57 yards in Dallas' 32-13 victory. Although he did score a touchdown, Davis also fumbled twice, leaving some to believe that his forearm is still hindering his ability to hold onto the ball. Look for the 'Skins to try and establish Davis early in next week's game against the Steelers, as Washington looks to keep their slim playoff hopes alive. Kurt Warner , QB STL - Risk Managers Updated 12/11/00 Warner regained his early-season form Sunday completing 27-of-32 passes for 346 yards. Unfortunately many Fantasy owners were probably eliminated from the playoffs after his four-interception debacle last week. If you are one of the owners that survived, keep Warner in your lineup and ride him to Fantasy glory. Jeff George , QB WAS - The Snake Pit Updated 12/11/00 George was a disappointment to Fantasy owners who picked him up for this week's game against Dallas. The veteran quarterback completed 19-of-33 passes for 235 yards and only one score in the game. George will remain the starter for the final two games so look for better numbers on Saturday against Pittsburgh, whose secondary was blasted by the Giants' Kerry Collins this week. Marshall Faulk , RB STL - FDIC Updated 12/11/00 Faulk was a Fantasy juggernaut Sunday rushing for four touchdowns. He gained 135 yards on 25 carries, and added six catches for 43 yards. With his performance Sunday he re-affirmed himself as the best Fantasy running back. Travis Prentice , RB CLE - Murder Inc. Updated 12/11/00 Prentice scored two one-yard touchdowns during Sunday's game against Philadelphia, and had 46 rushing yards on 17 carries on the day. He also bruised his right calf, although X-rays were negative. Although these numbers are more promising, we're not optimistic Prentice will help your Fantasy team when he goes up against Tennessee next Sunday. Cris Carter , WR MIN - Fear Updated 12/11/00 Carter had seven catches for 66 yards in Sunday's game against the Rams. He will have another formidable test against the Packers this week, but Carter will be up for the task. He struggled in their first meeting but still managed to make five catches for 59 yards and score a touchdown. Randall Cunningham , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 Cunningham was listed as the third-string quarterback in Sunday's game against the Redskins because of a nagging groin injury. When Troy Aikman went down with a concussion, Anthony Wright replaced him in the lineup, leaving Cunningham on the bench. With Dallas' starting quarterback situation up in the air for next week, Fantasy owners should avoid starting Cowboys' quarterbacks all together. Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 Northcutt alternated with Doug Pederson at quarterback during Sunday's game against Philadelphia, although he did not attempt a pass. He had seven carries for 37 yards rushing, and five catches for 44 yards receiving in the game. Unfortunately, Northcutt sprained his ankle on the final punt return of the game. Despite the decent yardage totals, he won't have enough Fantasy value to help you at this important stage of the season. Randy Moss , WR MIN - Mean Machine Updated 12/11/00 Moss was held to four catches for 64 yards and a touchdown Sunday. Look for Moss to have a better game against the Packers this week. He had six catches for 130 yards in their first meeting this season. Giants , DT NYG - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 The Giants' defense continues to be solid, holding their last three opponents to 24 combined points. This week' opponent, the Dallas Cowboys, could be without both Troy Aikman (concussion) and Randall Cunningham (groin), leaving third-string quarterback Anthony Wright to man the ship. Dallas' offense has struggled for most of the season, so the G-Men should hold the 'Boys in check for most of the game. Unless you own a defense with a better matchup, Fantasy owners should strongly consider starting the Giants' D this week. More Updates Copyright 2000 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

"Hey: 1. Theoretically we could agree upon a trade and cross it on ICE after hours when the risk that someone else gets inside is remote. This is a prearranged trade and is illegal on Nymex, but it is my understanding it will be legal on ICE assuming ICE uses the IPE clearing platform, where prearranged trading is legal. Agree about liquidity. I dont think this really helps ICE's volumes, nor liquidity. Funds want liquidity so they will not flock to ICE in the current state. 2. My guess is not intercommodity, but maybe intracommodity. For instance, a gas daily swap against front month futures may have lower margin than the 2 trades additive. Important Note: ICE is our competition and I am very,very wary to support their system, unless absolutely necessary. -----Original Message----- From: Abramo, Caroline Sent: Tuesday, September 18, 2001 2:00 PM To: 'doug@campbell.com' Cc: Zivic, Robyn Subject: ICE Hi.. I hope you are all ok.. I am sorry for any losses that may have touched your friends and family.. I looked at the ICE/LCH announcements. I have a few questions: 1. Will ICE be able to work as a deal entry system as well as mechanism to post markets? My concern here is that under the Deutsche proposal we would be able to do a deal with you over the phone and then post it to their system.. and no other market participant would be able to see that transaction.. it would then go straight to the clearing. Currently, I'd say that only 2% of the time ICE has a tighter market than EOL.. this because they do not have the liquidity (and likely will not). There is not a high probability we would ever contribute to this liquidity over our own system (Enron online) so the ability to deal directly with you in still imperative. 2. Can margin at LCH be netted across products? Looking forward to speaking. Thanks and Regards, Caroline",ham

Woudl expect if you get heat to see some utilities use their storage and burn some fuel but unless Natty goes back up to 4 ish I think we may be off the mrkt for a little bit here.

"http://www.phc.mpr.org/posthost/index.shtml Dear Garrison, There are at least six plans about what to do with ""Ground Zero"" in New York. I believe a suitable memorial surrounded by a lovely park with benches, walkways, children's playgrounds, possibly some concessions such as a restaurant, small theater and a place for art works would be the best tribute to those who lost their lives. What do you think should done with the space? Joe Adams Hillsdale, New Jersey I dread the thought of a big memorial in Manhattan that's designed by committee and that's gone through public hearings and so forth ----- it's going to be cold and ugly and pretentious and the upshot will be one more public space that the public hates, of which there are plenty already. New York is a bustling commercial city and that's the beauty of it, it's a city of young ambitious dreamy people, like the folks who died in the towers, and it's not a memorializing city. Historic events occurred in New York that in any other city would be commemorated with interpretive centers and guides and historical museums and in New York there's barely a little plaque. That's a great thing, in my estimation. It's a hustling city, full of immigrants looking for their big chance, and compared to that spirit of entrepreneurship, a memorial plaza with a fountain and a statue of something seems dead to me. Look at Grant's Tomb. Who walks past it and thinks about President Grant? Nobody. People sit in the plaza by Grant's Tomb and think about lunch, about sex, about money, about all the things that New York is about. If you want to find Grant, read his memoirs. His monument seems odd in New York: it belongs in Washington, which is our memorial city. New York is for the young and lively.",ham
"George, The probability of building a house this year is increasing. I have shifted to a slightly different plan. There were too many design items that I could not work out in the plan we discussed previously. Now, I am leaning more towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center. One wing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3 kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs. The other wing would have a garage + guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs. This plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor living. I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west. The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass skylights supported by metal posts. I am envisioning the two wings to have single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building. I don't know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe. I would like to come and visit you again this month. If it would work for you, I would like to drive up on Sunday afternoon on Feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm. I would like to see the progress on the house we looked at and tour the one we didn't have time for. I can bring more detailed drawings of my new plan. Call or email to let me know if this would work for you. pallen70@hotmail.com or 713-463-8626(home), 713-853-7041(work) Phillip Allen PS.

"Thad, Would you please get the calendars of your execs synchronized, and tell us which 2-day period the week of January 8 - 12, 2001 works best for our mutual meetings? We were originally looking at the 9th, 10th, or 11th as days to choose from primarily to avoid having the EBS executives located in the western U.S. travel from Portland, OR on Sunday for meetings on Monday in NJ. Consequently, I had asked the EBS executives to pencil in the 9th - 11th of January, and got the final one to confirm late last week. However, Kim Godfrey at EBS may have some new requirements; which is why I need your help in an expedited way - I'll need to give Kim your executives' availability during that week, and then we'll get things locked in ASAP.The meetings would still be scheduled such that the 1st meeting day would be for the meetings to be held during the 2nd half of that day, from 2-4 hours of meeting time for the executives (VP & up, primarily) to discuss possible alignments and opportunities. This would include two primary areas: 1) EBS-sell-to-Avaya for Avaya internal use: what types of potential solutions EBS could offer Avaya for Avaya's internal use; and 2) EBS & Avaya join together in a product and/or marketing effort to determine what kinds of solutions which the could jointly propose to the (common) markets served: ""sell with"" (each other); and ""sell through"" (channels type efforts), where either or both Avaya and EBS would act as sales channels for each other's sales forces. These meetings would be followed by the 2nd day's session(s), which would include primarily development and marketing team members who would discuss areas in which Avaya and EBS could develop one or more joint value propositions, such that they would have a ""jumping off point"" for a go-to-market effort (item #2, above). In addition, the technical aspects of some of the ""EBS-would-like-to-sell-its-services-to-Avaya-for-Avaya-internal-use"" (item #1, above) meetings from the Executive session the 1st day could then be addressed. Please let me know which 2-day period looks like the most workable one for your executives at Avaya HQ during the week of 1/8/01, so that I can get to Kim to allow her to get the EBS executives' schedules locked into days synchronized with your executives'.

The techniques Chinese Internet Service Providers are using to enforce these rules, however, all depend on the fact that traffic to and from Google, or indeed almost all public websites, is unencrypted. Almost all Web browsers, however, include support for Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption for securing credit card numbers and the like. Upgrading to SSL makes it effectively impossible for a 'man-in-the-middle' to meddle; censorship would have to be imposed on each individual computer in China. The only choice left is to either ban the entire site (range of IP addresses), but not the kind of selective filtering reported on in the article. Of course, the additional computing power to encrypt all this traffic costs real money. If the United States is so concerned about the free flow of information, why shouldn't the Broadcasting Board of Governors sponsor an encrypted interface to Google, or for that matter, the rest of the Web? To date, public diplomacy efforts have focused on public-sector programming for the Voice of America, Radio Sawa, and the like. Just imagine if the US government got into the business of subsidizing secure access to private-sector media instead. Nothing illustrates the freedom of the press as much as the wacky excess of the press itself -- and most of it is already salted away at Google and the Internet Archive project. On second thought, I can hardly imagine this Administration *promoting* the use of encryption to uphold privacy rights. Never mind... Best, Rohit Khare =========================================================== The search goes on China backtracks on banning Google—up to a point Sep 19th 2002 | BEIJING From The Economist print edition IN CHINESE, the nickname for Google, an American Internet search engine, is gougou, meaning “doggy”. For the country's fast-growing population of Internet users (46m, according to an official estimate), it is proving an elusive creature. Earlier this month, the Chinese authorities blocked access to Google from Internet service providers in China—apparently because the search engine helped Chinese users to get access to forbidden sites. Now, after an outcry from those users, access has been restored. An unusual climbdown by China's zealous Internet censors? Hardly. More sophisticated controls have now been imposed that make it difficult to use Google to search for material deemed offensive to the government. Access is still blocked to the cached versions of web pages taken by Google as it trawls the Internet. These once provided a handy way for Chinese users to see material stored on blocked websites. After the blocking of Google on August 31st, many Chinese Internet users posted messages on bulletin boards in China protesting against the move. Their anger was again aroused last week when some Chinese Internet providers began rerouting users trying to reach the blocked Google site to far less powerful search engines in China. Duncan Clark, the head of a Beijing-based technology consultancy firm, BDA (China) Ltd, says China is trying a new tactic in its efforts to censor the Internet. Until recently, it had focused on blocking individual sites, including all pages stored on them. Now it seems to be filtering data transmitted to or from foreign websites to search for key words that might indicate undesirable content. For example earlier this week when using Eastnet, a Beijing-based Internet provider, a search on Google for Falun Gong—a quasi-Buddhist exercise sect outlawed in China— usually aborted before all the results had time to appear. Such a search also rendered Google impossible to use for several minutes.",ham

"How (not) to speak English Properly 1. Verbs HAS to agree with their subjects. 2. Prepositions are not words to end sentences with. 3. And don't start a sentence with a conjunction. 4. It is wrong to ever split an infinitive. 5. Avoid cliches like the plague. (They're old hat) 6. Also, always avoid annoying alliteration. 7. Be more or less specific. 8. Parenthetical remarks (however relevant) are (usually) unnecessary. 9. Also too, never, ever use repetitive redundancies. 10. No sentence fragments. 11. Contractions aren't necessary and shouldn't be used. 12. Foreign words and phrases are not apropos. 13. Do not be redundant; do not use more words than necessary; it's highly superfluous. 14. One should NEVER generalize. 15. Comparisons are as bad as cliches. 16. Eschew ampersands & abbreviations, etc. 17. One-word sentences? Eliminate. 18. Analogies in writing are like feathers on a snake. 19. The passive voice is to be ignored. 20. Eliminate commas, that are, not necessary. Parenthetical words however should be enclosed in commas. 21. Never use a big word when a diminutive one would suffice. 22. Use words correctly, irregardless of how others use them. 23. Understatement is always the absolute best way to put forth earth-shaking ideas. 24. Eliminate quotations. As Ralph Waldo Emerson said, ""I hate quotations. Tell me what you know."" 25. If you've heard it once, you've heard it a thousand times: Resist hyperbole; not one writer in a million can use it correctly. 26. Puns are for children, not groan readers. 27. Go around the barn at high noon to avoid colloquialisms. 28. Even IF a mixed metaphor sings, it should be derailed. 29. Who needs rhetorical questions? 30. Exaggeration is a billion times worse than understatement. And the last one... 31. Proofread carefully to see if you any words out.",ham

"Big Bob, Writing to say hello. I returned to the states three weeks ago and have been working at Camp Horno with the 1/1 since that time. It has been about three weeks. The job is actually pretty good. I run the sick call for the unit and do someother admin type things. Other than that my time is pretty much my own. No call over nifgt every third night at the hospital or some asshole doctor chewing your ass about taking care of patients. I still feel kind of out of the loop with the other Marine officers but something tells me that probably will not change. Likely, they look at me like the friendly and tolerable neighborhood nerd who is there to take care of the troops and give people light duty chits. At least they leave me alone and give me a chance to work out. The hills around Camp P are brutal and unforgiving.

The coaching staff has yet to name a starter. I rate his chances at 85% to start. QB Jay Fiedler (Mia) was able to practice Wednesday and now looks like he will start this Sunday. He is listed as questionable on the injury report with a sore shoulder and neck. QB Drew Bledsoe (NE) continues to take a pounding. He appears as questionable on the injury report again with a sore thumb and a bruised ego. He missed practice on Tuesday, but typically plays hurt. If he can not go, look for John Friesz (and his less than 100% knee) to take the field. QB Aaron Brooks (NO) is turning quite a few heads with his stellar play. He starts again this week. QB Kordell Stewart (Pit) is probable with a sore calf, but expects to start. QB Jerome Bettis (Pit) has a sore leg, but it will take a lot more than that to keep him off the field. QB Moses Moreno (SD) needs to trade away a commandment or two for a more durable body. He appears on the injured list again as questionable with a sore knee. Ryan Leaf, who has a sore groin, will start again in his place. QB Jon Kitna (Sea) gets the start this week for the injured Brock Huard. Brock is out indefinitely with a bruised kidney and was just released from the hospital earlier this week. QB Kurt Warner (StL) took snaps and has looked great throwing in practice. He will start this week. Trent Green will back him up. QB Shaun King (TB) practiced on Wednesday and looks to start against the Cowboys. Eric Zeier would play if Shaun king suffered a set-back. QB Steve McNair (Ten) practiced on Wednesday and looks to start this week. He is listed as questionable on the injury report with a hurt thumb. QB Brad Johnson (Was) is back behind center while Jeff George watches. I doubt we have seen the last of this controversy. //////////////////////////////// Running backs in the News: RB Obafemi Ayanbadejo (Bal) is gone for the season. RB Jamal Lewis (Bal) is on a bye this week. RB Sammy Morris (Buf) was able to practice briefly on Wednesday and is questionable for this week's game. He is having trouble making the hard cuts so will likely be ineffective even if he plays. RB William Floyd (Car) will miss this game. RB Tim Biakabutuka (Car) likely returns to the lineup this week. He is listed as probable with a sore toe. RB Jamel White (Cle) is banged up with a sore shoulder. Look for Travis Prentice to ""shoulder"" more of the load this week. RB Emmitt Smith (Dal) has shaken off the concussion and will start this week. RB Terrell Davis (Den) is out this week with calf problems. Mike Anderson gets the start again this week. RB Detron Smith (Den) can play if needed with his sore thumb. RB Dorsey Levens (GB) misses yet another game. Ahman Green will get the start. RB Lamar Smith (Mia) practiced on Wednesday and is expected to be the starter despite being listed as questionable on the injury report with a tender hamstring. RB Jimmy Kleinsasser (Min) is probable with a sore hamstring. RB JR Redmond (NE) appears as questionable on the injury report with bruised ribs, but he expects to play. RB Ricky Williams (NO) is healing way ahead of schedule. He may now be ready for the last game of the regular season. His cast is expected to come off later this week. RB Jerald Moore (NO) is listed as questionable on the injury report with a sore neck. He is still expected to start though, but Chad Morton may see a few more reps than usual. RB Curtis Martin (NYJ) plans on playing through the pain. He is listed as probable with a sore gluteous. I am guessing he is the butt of many New York jokes. RB Leon Johnson has been re-signed by the Jets and will return punts. RB Tyrone Wheatley (Oak) is banged up with a sore knee and finger, but his ankles are better. He will play this week. RB Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala (Pit) is out this week and he is using the time to look for personalized items with his last name. We will keep you posted. RB Kenny Bynum (SD) is listed as questionable with a sore hamstring. On a team that already has a crowded backfield with Jermaine Fazande and Terrell Fletcher, Kenny looks like he could be placed on the inactive list this week. RB Terrell Fletcher (SD) has a broken rib, but is expected to play with the pain. RB Garrison Hearst (SF) is listed as questionable on the injury report, but is doubtful he would have played anyway. The team remains cautious in his comeback. RB Mike Alstott (TB) will not play this week. Look for Warrick Dunn to get plenty of opportunities against a soft Dallas defense. RB Eddie George (Ten) skipped Wednesday's practice, but expects to practice today and play this weekend. RB Larry Centers (Was) is listed as questionable with a sore knee. RB Stephen Davis (Was) will play with his sore forearm. Look for the Giants to attempt to arm-tackle him all day. /////////////////////////////////// Wide Receivers in the News: WR Frank Sanders (Ari) is expected to play with a sore leg. WR Brian Finneran (Atl) practiced on Wednesday and is expected to play with a sore back. WR Qadry Ismail (Bal) is on a bye this week. WR Jermaine Lewis (Bal) will use this week to heal his shoulder he injured in last week's game. WR Peerless Price (Buf) is expected to play with a sore ankle. WR Donald Hayes (Car) is expected to start with a sore groin. WR Darrin Chiaverini (Cle) is listed as questionable with a sore knee. He did not practice on Wednesday. WR Germane Crowell (Det) is out again this week. Johnnie Morton and Herman Moore will start in his absence. WR Corey Bradford (GB) has spent more time on the injury report than Yancey Thigpen(((well maybe not, but he can't stay healthy either. Corey misses another game this week as he is officially listed as out. WR EG Green (Ind) still has a sprained knee and is listed as questionable on the injury report. He says he will be ready to play though. WR OJ McDuffie (Mia) is questionable with a sore toe. With Tony Martin now healthy, the team will likely rest OJ so that he can heal for the playoffs. WR Troy Brown (NE) is listed as questionable on the injury report with a sore leg, but he expects to play. WR Jake Reed (NO) is out in likely more ways than his listing on the injury report. Joe Horn and Willie Jackson are playing good enough to hold onto the starting jobs even if Jake were to get healthy. WR Ike Hilliard (NYG) is out with a bruised sternum. Joe Jurevicius will start in his place. WR Dedric Ward (NYJ) gets the start over Laveranues Coles who is out with a twisted knee. WR Courtney Hawkins (Pit) is questionable this week with a sore knee, but even if he played he would likely be ineffective. Hines Ward has been the only Pittsburgh receiver to do anything consistently all year. WR Terrell Owens (SF) is not a lock to play, but he keeps talking like he will be on the field though. He was quoted in the Sacramento Bee as saying he is 85% right now. I am guessing he is closer to 70%, but he probably will play if he can handle the pain from his turf toe. WR Tony Horne (Stl) is out this week with a toe injury. WR Az-Zahir Hakim (Stl) is expected to play with his sore knee this week. WR Carl Pickens (Ten) continues to miss time with a sore hamstring. Even if he plays, he does not look like he will be a big factor. WR Albert Connell (Was) got a break when the doctors upgraded his condition. He remains sore though and may be a game-time decision to whether he plays. The team is starting James Thrash and Irving Fryar so he may have limited value even if he suits up this week. WR James Thrash (Was) has a bruised thigh, but is expected to play this week. /////////////////////////////// Tight Ends in the News: TE Reggie Kelly (Atl) practiced on Wednesday and is expected to play with a sore knee. TE Shannon Sharpe (Bal) is on a bye this week. TE OJ Santiago (Cle) is bothered by a sore knee. Fantasy players are bothered that he is still mentioned as a player in the NFL. TE Aaron Shea (Cle) is listed as questionable with sore quadriceps. He was limited in practice, but expects to play in the game. TE Jackie Harris (Dal) was quoted as saying he will play this weekend. He is expected to practice on Thursday and is listed as questionable on the injury report with a sore knee. TE Tony Gonzalez (KC) is perfectly fine and just did not catch a pass last week from 6 attempts from Warren Moon. If Grbac plays, expect him to get the ball to Tony again. TE Hunter Goodwin (Mia) has a tight hamstring, but is expected to play. TE Johnny McWilliams (Min) is now the starter. John Davis still gets a lot of looks though. TE Chad Lewis (Phi) is expected to play with a sore elbow. /////////////////////////////// Kickers in the News: PK David Akers (Phi) is expected to play with a pulled quad. PK Jeff Wilkins (Stl) looks like he will kick this week. But he has looked like he was ready before and then gave way to Jeff Hall minutes before game-time. Now that the Rams are tied for first though, expect the players to start working through the pain. I rate Wilkins chance to start at close to 90% this week.

"Z/F !!!! wow. Who would have thunk it. Prompt gas at $6+ and Z/F as wide as last year. Hard to think of a better scenario for it to flip. Rather, hard to think of any scenario for any z/f to be contango. if it couldn't do it this year.... A lot of boys max withdrawing out of storage because that's what the curve told them to do last bid week. Obviously, more gas trying to come out than is being burned, so you have to incentivize an economic player, like an Enron, to inject. Problem is if we stick it in the ground now, we're pulling it out in G. When you had z/g at 35 back and cash getting priced off g, cash/z looks awfully weak, thus putting a lot of pressure on z/f. Storage economics will always dictate this market except maybe latter half of winter. Buyers of h/j at 70 certainly hope so anyways. Agree with you that back half of the winter should be strong. storage boys are withdrawing today and buying that. bottom fishing in f/g yet or is it going to zero? slafontaine@globalp.com on 11/22/2000 06:50:46 AM To: John.Arnold@enron.com cc: Subject: re:mkts agree on jan/feb-i cudnt resist sold a little yest at 39-will prob end up buying em back at +45 and piss away the rest of my month fyi-if you ever have a chance to speak on the phone feel free to call-my time is busy but managed only by me not paper flow and eol. so i dont bother you with calls just an occasional email to give you the time to respond when you have the time. im also susprised about dec/jan-mad a few bucks trading it both ways but one cant help wonder given these loads-gass crazy out west-the so called impact of husbanding by end users yet the frontn of the curve still cant backwardate at all-indeed makes all the sprds look very rich agaon. also will be curious how these ""loan deals"" by pipes work ouut. man these guys cud really be getting themselves in trouble-another big reason dec cash hasnt been able to go over jan-but i think it will make them strong longs in the back of the mkt?? ie are they taking the gas back in march, april?? shud keep that part of the curve very strong agree? be cool my man-talk later",ham

"Here is my summary of our second round summer interviews. Top 3 candidates below. 1. Craig - Well rounded, Military background, excellent leadership experience (aircraft carrier pilot), did not have a finance background, but performed very well on Harry's analytical interview. Very personable, confident and sold himself well. I think he is very interested in Enron and would likely accept. 2. Victor - He was a strong candidate in my more subjective interview, but I didn't think he was quite as strong as Ajay. However he outperformed Ajay in the analytical interview. With that feedback from Harry I feel comfortable placing Victor ahead of Ajay. Also very interested in Enron. 3. Ajay - Very polished, presented/sold himself very well, Excellent understanding of Enron's business (did his homework), Relative to others based on my interview he ranked in the top 2, However did not perform as well as others in the top 4-5 in the analytical interview. For this reason I'd push him back to number three. Aside from these three there were two others that are worth discussing. Casey Jones Andrew Rosenberg We Understand these two may have outstanding offers from firms that they are very interested in. I would not consider either of these two ahead of Craig, but might place Casey ahead of Victor. However I think Casey is least likely to accept the offer. My suggestion would be to make offers to Craig & Victor, then consider a 3rd offer to Andrew, recognizing we would likely get a maximum of 2/3. Lee Jackson",ham

"In regards to gas: what signals do you for in determining your view? what resources do you use to formulate a price view? give example of complex transaction you've structured for a customer. where is storage now relative to history? what is the highest and lowest level we've been at in past 5 years? what are your short, medium, and long term views of gas market? what major basis changes have occured in the market over the past 5 years? What do you expect in the next 5? how should a storage operator decide whether or not to inject on any given day? In regards to derivatives in order of difficulty What are delta/gamma/theta? if you buy a put spread, is your delta positive, negative, or zero? Is swap price equal to simple average of futures contracts? If interest rates go up what happens to option prices all else equal? what is the value of a european $1 call expiring in 12 months if corresponding futures are trading $5? what happens to delta of an option if volatility increase?

"Steve/Chaz - I have taken your EBS Professional Services contract through our contracts folks, and we have ended up with it now being in EBS' contracts dept w/one of your attorneys. Our contracts Director, Tom Moore, and I spoke w/Eric Merten (PDX) early this afternoon, and he now has the contract. EBS may have some Intellectual Property issues related to ownership of BMC Consultant-developed materials (while being paid by Enron). Eric is in the driver's seat with the contract at this point. I have sent notes to all of the Net Works directors currently engaged in one form or another with BMC product and/or personnel. In it, they have been requested to help us understand our opportunity from a number of angles: Application(s) considered, attractiveness of the new pricing, attractiveness of the BMC flexibility w/regard to ""purchase commitment"", etc. In addition, I have re-iterated the time urgency. I have followed up the note w/telephone calls & messages to all of them: Doug Cummins, Randy Matson, Bob Martinez, Jim Ogg, and Bruce Smith. I am meeting with Bob Martinez on Wednesday at 3pm. Matson, Ogg, and Smith have me in their voicemailbox, Cummins was in a meeting and he said he would call me back. Would either one of you please let me know what BMC wants EBS to do for them: how much do they want you to guarantee them in BMC revenue? Are you still looking at a $13MM TCV over 5 years? Have I properly conveyed the ""accepable-to-BMC method"" of proving purchase commitment from Enron? Your note re: getting the Prof'nl Svcs contract signed says it has to be done by 6pm the 14th...what if you don't get it until the morning of the 15th? I will call you to follow up on this note.

"I will be happy to help. Mike, please give me a call at 3-0977 and we can set up a time that is good for you to observe. Eric Enron North America Corp. From: Brenda F Herod 07/26/2000 01:14 PM To: Eric Bass/HOU/ECT@ECT, David Baumbach/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Steve Venturatos/HOU/ECT@ECT, Michael Taylor/ENRON@Gateway, George Smith/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: I need your help!! Michael Taylor is a summer intern from LSU, finance major, who has been working in Logistics for the Central Desk. He will be at ENA for the next couple of weeks (through 8/11, I believe). He has not had an opportunity to really see our business from the trading perspective or Risk perspective. I had the opportunity to have lunch with Mike yesterday, and we brainstormed on some options to get him some exposure to these areas prior to leaving ENA. THis where I need your help! Eric - As I always do, I sang your praises to Mike, and I thought you would be a good person for Mike to sit with to observe your current role in the analyst program on the Texas Trading Desk. Additionally, since you were in Risk also, I thought you could give him an insightful perspective of how the Risk experience has helped you to move to your current role. If you can swing it, I think it would be great if Mike could sit with you one day, and you could explain to him your job, your thoughts behind your actions, the data you watch, etc. Obviously, the intent is educational, not interference. So I will leave it to the two of you to work out the best approach and timing. Dave - As I mentioned to you yesterday, I sang your praises also to Mike, and I'm glad the two of you were able to meet. As we discussed, Mike would like to have some exposure to the Risk role, so it would be nice if he could sit with the group when the books and position are being calced. I will leave it to the two of you to coordinate the day. Mike's current role in Logistics brings him into the office at 4:00am to prepare the morning report. As I understand it, his responsibilities are critical up until trading. So late morning and early afternoon might be the best time, but you all can work through it. When he sits with Risk, he'll probably go home and them return when you all start calcing. George - Obviously Mike's first responsibilities are to Central Logistics, and these other opportunities are really on his own time. We just thought it would be good for him to have a Risk/Trading perspective when he is trying to evaluate job opportunities. I appreciate your support in this, but please let me know if you have any concerns. When Mike leaves Enron, he will be going to Seattle to participate in MicroSoft's co-op program for the reaminder of 2000. Obviously, he will have a great company to compare us to but at the end of the day, we want to ensure he has a great perspective on the opportunities that Enron can offer. I appreciate your time to help Mike.",ham

As you can tell from the proforma this project should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years. This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for this market. This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we have uncovered to date in the Austin market. The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan. As it is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austin for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete in less than 6 months. Additionally, many of the current and more severe water treatment ordinances have been waived. I have estimated the lot improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street widening. Even though this property is not likely to require street widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond requirement, I used this data to be cautious. The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not expected to impact sales significantly. Other projects have been quite successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University. As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods is uneven. We have included a fence around the entire property, but may only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop. Gated communities are far preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer preferences. The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and an extended escrow. This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan. This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the profits of the project. As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity with your profit in the lot. I believe this would facilitate the use of a 1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then be the equity for that project. You would need to discuss this with an exchange expert first. Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San Antonio if you do not know anyone. I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker, by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery. Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to schedule a tour of the site and the area. Please get back to me as soon as your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any time. You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either 512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110. My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is 512-338-1103. I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you on this project that is sure to be a major winner. I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual events these past few weeks. A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes. One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to start the next day. The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough to knock it down. The City shut down the project for a week and it took another week to get every thing back on tract. Then last week I had to take my wife to emergency. She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this past week.. There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize the enormous number of things she does everyday. Fortunately, it looks as if she will be ok in the long run. George W.

"Tom has come to a decision on what to do with the ubiquitous accrual value. 60% of this value should be credited to Greg's Transport expense on a monthly basis. Tom, in turn, will cover Ed on this portion of the expense. For example: Accrual Value comes out to be $300,000 for the month of April. This means that: Greg's portion of this value is 60% of $300,000 = $180,000 Tom's portion of this value is 40% of $300,000 = $120,000 Greg's Transport Expense is ($700,000) So, Tom will cover $180,000 of this expense Greg's adjusted Expense is ($520,000) Greg's P&L is net better off by the $180,000 of accrual value Tom's P&L is net better off by $120,000 of accrual value which had not been previously recognized. Ed's P&L is net unchanged from all of the above. Call with questions. Eric x3-0977",ham
"> You have multiple generations of > peasants/squatters that cultivate and live on the lands almost as a > human parts of the property package. When I'd read that ""getting legal title can take 20 years"", when I believe that 1 year ought to be more than sufficient, (and helped by the Cairo reference) I'd assumed that we were talking about the urban poor. If I see people living in mansions, or even in suburban subdivisions, I assume they didn't have too much trouble with their titles. If I see people living in shanties and haphazard alleyways, I tend to assume their parcels weren't exactly recorded on the government maps, or paid for with a bank loan, especially when nearby vacant lots have shotgun wielding men presumably intent on keeping them ""development"" free. Now, it may be that ""Manhattanites' view of America"" to say that outside of Metro Manila, Davao, and maybe another city or two (Cebu?), everything else (literally) is the boondocks. But going on that very broad assumption, I guess I'm describing the flip side of Mr. Roger's experience: the paisanos (who leave behind those who remain on a patron's rural land) move to Manila, and (the second assumption) squat in shantytowns there, at least until they can line up a middle-class job. So, going on two large assumptions, I can come up with a scenario under which title would take 20 years: a shantytown arises somewhere in the midst of a section (or whatever the Spanish used to divvy up the land) and it takes decades of arguing to put together a package which somehow can both compensate the owner and record lots for the inhabitants. Just transferring title to an existing lot, between parties who have money, ought not to be a problem. The obvious solution, at least to us barking farting chihuahuas on FoRK, is to ""introduce market mechanisms"". It is left as an exercise to come up with one which works when many of the agents (are perceived to) have negligible NPV. -Dave > [land reform] meant that all the agricultural producers had > to plant crops all the time (profitable or not) ...

"BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS TRANSACTION DEVELOPMENT Transaction Development, headed by Rodney Malcolm, works with Pulp & Paper, Lumber and Steel to structure and execute some of the more complex deals. Members of the Transaction Development team have a strong track record of closing structured transactions involving both capital and commodity risks. Sample deals would include working on the acquisition of Garden State Paper earlier this year, and structuring and pitching the first all requirements, index based, physical steel supply contract to one of the largest players in the steel servicing segment of the steel industry. The ability to buy and sell physical product will be critical to creating a commodity product in these businesses. Getting access to the physical product will require creating compelling financing structures, as well as potentially buying assets to get control of their production capability. In all these situations, the Transaction Development team will be a key player in driving these opportunities to closure.

"Subject: cave memo To: Cave mates From: Osama Re: The Cave Hi guys. We've all been putting in long hours but we've really come together as a group and I love that. Big thanks to Omar for putting up the poster that says, ""There is no I in team"" as well as the one that says ""Hang In There, Baby."" That cat is hilarious. However, while we are fighting a jihad, we can't forget to take care of the cave. And frankly I have a few concerns. First of all, while it's good to be concerned about cruise missiles, we should be even more concerned about the scorpions in our cave. Hey, you don't want to be stung and neither do I, so we need to sweep the cave daily. I've posted a sign up sheet near the main cave opening. Second, it's not often I make a video address but when I do, I'm trying to scare the most powerful country on earth, okay? That means that while we're taping, please do not ride your razor scooters in the background. Just while we're taping. Thanks. Third point, and this is a touchy one. As you know, by edict, we're not supposed to shave our beards. But I need everyone to just think hygiene, especially after mealtime. We're all in this together. Fourth: food. I bought a box of Cheez-Its recently, clearly wrote ""Osama"" on the front, and put it on the top shelf. Today, my Cheez-Its were gone. Consideration. That's all I'm saying. Finally, we've heard that there may be American soldiers in disguise trying to infiltrate our ranks. I want to set up patrols to look for them. First patrol will be Omar, Muhammed, Abdul, Akbar, and Richard. Love you lots.

Apparently I missed a little craziness. My point on v/x is that forward spreads, months 3/4 and back, don't necessarily trade on value, they trade on drawing a forward curve that makes equilibrium between hedging and spec demand. Look at k/m... do you think k cash will average 3 cents above m. i don't really see that scenario. yet that's what it is worth because the market says jv is worth $x and to get there k/m=3. The same argument applies to v/x. i think this summer will be exceptionally strong as we try to inject 2 bcf/d more gas than last year. But cal 2 will lag the move. It's the main thing customers are selling right now because every equity analyst and even Pira are telling their customers that cal 2 will average 3.50. so either the v/x and x/z spreads come in or f/g g/h h/j blow out. After this winter, who in there right mind wants to buy f/g or g/h again. my thought is that the primary juice will be h/j but v/x and x/z will be under some pressure. i'm a seller at 9 and buyer at 5-6.

"George, Here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders profit. Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be recouped in the first year of operation. At permanent financing $1.1 would be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year. Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split. However, as I mentioned earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as part of the construction contract. Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look like here are a few ideas: 1. Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million. Builder doesn't benefit from higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder. 2. +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 1 complete in November) +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but could be as favorable as 55/45. I realize that what is budget and schedule must be discussed and agreed upon. Feel free to call me at home (713)463-8626 Phillip",ham

"Today, a Florida judge supported FL Secretary of State Katherine Harris' decision to reject hand-counted votes submitted after the November 14 statewide county certification deadline. The judge, a Democrat, found Harris had exercised proper discretion. Governor Bush believes the way to conclude this election, in a fair, accurate and final way, is for the state of Florida to count the remaining overseas ballots, add them to the certified vote, and announce the results, as required by Florida law. Florida citizens are ready for and will accept this result, according to two new polls. According to a new Mason-Dixon poll, 71% of Floridians believe waiting to declare a winner by the end of this weekend is ACCEPTABLE, while 60% believe waiting several weeks to declare a winner is TOO LONG TO WAIT. Furthermore, according to a new NBC/WSJ poll, 81% will accept George W. Bush as winner based on the overseas absentee ballots count plus the current machine tally. ------------------- Meanwhile, the Gore campaign says they want a full, fair and accurate count, but today, the LA Times reports on how they hope to achieve their real objectives... SEASONED DEMOCRATIC ARMY HITS THE SHORES OF FLORIDA excerpts from The Los Angeles Times: ""To scrounge for every last vote, Gore has flooded Fort Lauderdale with tough, seasoned Democrats, the sort who are used to keeping wafflers in line and to count and recount votes until they know exactly what it will take to outdo their opponents. Many of the hired hands speak with a Boston brogue... ""Not far away, in an abandoned Payless shoe store, vanloads of AFL-CIO staffers and Gore loyalists from New York, Chicago, Nashville, Philadelphia, San Francisco and elsewhere had disembarked to learn how to observe the ballot count. ""'Our goal,' said one lawyer as he patiently lectured his new charges, 'is to preserve the Al Gore vote.' The volunteers nodded. 'It's very, very important that if you see any kind of mark--a scratch, a dent, a pinprick in Al Gore's column--that you challenge.' When someone then asked what they should do if they found a Bush ballot with an indent, the lawyer said: 'Keep your lips sealed.' It was hardball that the Bostonians and other imported pros understood well.""

Latest NBA Player News Chris Mills , F GS - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 The Warriors put Mills on the injured list on Tuesday with an inflamed right ankle. The veteran has averaged 12.0 points and 6.2 rebounds in 15 games this season. Mills does have some Fantasy value, especially in deeper leagues, so keep him on the bench unless you can find an adequate replacement on the waiver wire. Adonal Foyle , C GS - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 Foyle was activated on Tuesday night in time for Golden State's game against Portland. He had been on the injured list after having surgery to repair torn ligaments in his right ring finger. Foyle averaged 2.9 points and 4.4 rebounds in 16 games as a starter for the Warriors. Foyle has no Fantasy value at this point. Chris Crawford , F ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 Crawford was placed on the injured list Tuesday with a sprained left ankle and a sore right big toe. He is averaging 4.5 points in 19 games, and has no Fantasy value. Rod Strickland , G WAS - Fear Updated 12/12/00 Strickland left practice early on Monday due to some stiffness in both of his hamstrings. He is expected to play on Wednesday when the Wizards host Allen Iverson and the Sixers. Strickland is averaging 14.5 points and 7.2 assists per game for Fantasy owners this season, numbers which could be a great deal better if he wasn't stuck in Washington. Rasheed Wallace , F POR - Tribe Called PLove Updated 12/12/00 Wallace, who missed Saturday night's game against Detroit because of a injured right wrist, practiced on Monday with his wrist taped. He is close to 100 percent and is expected to play against Golden State on Tuesday night. Fantasy owners who rolled the dice and played Wallace this week will be happy that they did - Golden State's frontcourt has been decimated by injuries and will be easy prey for Wallace. Jerome Williams , F DET - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 Williams is currently on the injured list with a sprained right ankle. He is scheduled to have X-rays taken on the ankle on Tuesday, and won't be eligible to return to action until Dec. 19. He is averaging 8.1 points and 8.2 rebounds per game this season, and has marginal value in the world of Fantasy. James Posey , F DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 Posey and a handful of unnamed teammates may not play in Tuesday night's game against the Heat in protest over the actions of Head Coach Dan Issel. ""The team got together and discussed some things,"" said Posey, ""and (protesting) is what the conclusion was (Monday)."" Reports out of Denver say that the probems between the coach and his players escolated when Issel ripped Nuggets' center Raef LaFrentz after a recent loss to the Boston Celtics. If the protest does in fact take place, Fantasy owners will miss a night of production from some of their Denver players. Brevin Knight , G CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 It looks like Knight will be making a return trip to the injured list. The Cavs' reserve point guard is still feeling some discomfort in his right knee, and team officials are saying that he came off the injured list too soon. The Cavaliers are expected to activate point guard Michael Hawkins in time for their game against Dallas on Tuesday night. With Andre Miller at the point, neither Knight nor Hawkins has any real Fantasy value. Alan Henderson , F ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 Henderson was held out of workouts on Monday after spraining his left shoulder after a hard fall during Saturday night's game against Cleveland. Head Coach Lon Kruger said that he would wait until Tuesday to see how Henderson felt, but the former Hoosiers' star had different ideas. ""The shoulder's still attached to my body,"" said Henderson. ""No question I'll play."" Henderson has been a solid performer all season, and has been one of Atlanta's most consistent players. With trade rumors still swirling about Dikembe Mutombo, Henderson's Fantasy value could rise even further. If he is still available in your league, adding Henderson to your roster would be a smart move. Jim Jackson , G ATL - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/12/00 Jackson is set to make his return to the court on Tuesday night as the Hawks face off against the Kings. He has been taken off the injured list, where he has spent the last eight games with a knee sprain. With the emergence of Jason Terry at the two guard, Jackson will now switch back to his more natural small forward position. Before his injury, Jackson was Atlanta's leading scorer, averaging 17.1 points per game. The former Buckeye is worth a roster spot if he is still available in your league, and could be a solid replacement for those owners who just lost Eric Snow. Tim Duncan , F SA - The Old School Fools Updated 12/12/00 Fantasy owners got a real scare when Duncan went down, clutching his knee, during Monday's game against the Jazz. It was the same knee that Duncan had surgery on last season. He was diagnosed with a hyperextended left knee, but returned to the game in the fourth quarter. He will have further evaluations performed on Tuesday. Duncan, who leads the Spurs in both scoring and rebounding, is one of the most coveted stars in all of Fantasy. Eric Snow , G PHI - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/12/00 Snow, who has been placed on the injured list by Philadelphia, will undergo surgery on Tuesday to repair the fracture in his right ankle. He is expected to miss 6-8 weeks. Fantasy owners who had Snow on their roster would be wise to check their league's free agent list in order to replace him. If no viable alternatives are available, look to make a trade to bolster your lineup. Isaac Austin , C VAN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 Austin missed Monday night's game against the Rockets with the flu. He is listed on the NBA injury report as day-to-day. At 5.1 points and 4.6 rebounds per game, Austin has very little Fantasy value. Michael Dickerson , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00 Dickerson left Monday's game against the Rockets in the first quarter after aggravating a foot injury that he sustained during training camp. Head Coach Sidney Lowe said that Dickerson's condition will be evaluated on Tuesday. Fantasy owners who just got Dickerson back must now hold their breath once again and hope his latest injury isn't seroius. Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/12/00 In his first game back from injury, Hill led the Magic with 19 points in a surprising 92-80 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. He added seven rebounds and four assists in only 25 minutes of play. Hill shot 7-of-10 from the field, and looked like he is almost all the way back from his ankle injury - which should make his Fantasy owners very happy to have him back in their lineup. Shaquille O'Neal , C LAL - The Rounders Updated 12/11/00 O'Neal will receive his diploma at Louisiana State on Friday, causing him to miss that night's game against the Vancouver Grizzlies at Staples Center. He will miss the game with his team's blessing -- and won't be docked any of his $19.286 million season salary. His absence shouldn't hurt you in a Fantasy league that goess by averages but it could be a problem in leagues that go by total points. Avery Johnson , G SA - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 Johnson is suffering from a bruised left thigh and is questionable for Monday's showdown at Utah. Antonio Daniels will start at point guard if Johnson is unable to play. Even if he does play the bruise may sap him of his speed and hinder his Fantasy production. Bench Johnson for a while if possible. Gary Trent , F DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 Trent has been working out and could be close to making his return soon. Owner Mark Cuban told The Dallas Morning News that Trent will be back by Dec. 20 ""at the latest"". This should not persuade Fantasy owners to pick him up. Unless you desperately need a forward, wait and see if he remains healthy when he returns before you pick him up. Iakovos Tsakalidis , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 Tsakalidis was placed on the injured list due to a dental problem. When he was drafted during the offseason Phoenix hoped that he could move into the starting lineup. He has played sparingly so far this season and has been a major Fantasy bust. If you have him on your Fantasy team it's time for you to let him go. Predrag Stojakovic , F SAC - Fear Updated 12/11/00 Stojakovic missed his second straight game on Sunday night with a bruised right shoulder. He injured the shoulder in practice on Thursday and hasn't played since. In the wake of Stojakovic's injury, Fantasy owners may want to look elsewhere for a forward if your roster allows a solid replacement. Rasheed Wallace , F POR - Tribe Called PLove Updated 12/11/00 Wallace has been listed as day-to-day on the NBA's injury report with a sprained right wrist. He sustained the injury during Friday night's loss to the Sixers and missed Saturday's game against Detroit. Wallace, who is one of the league's few solid Fantasy centers, has averaged 20.1 points per game to lead the Blazers this season. With so few options at center, some Fantasy owners may have to roll the dice with Wallace this week and hope he returns to the court for Tuesday night's game at Golden State. Kobe Bryant , G LAL - Tribe Called PLove Updated 12/11/00 Bryant suffered a slight sprain on his left ankle during Sunday's game against the Pistons. The injury is not serious, and the league's leading scorer isn't expected to miss any time. Continue starting Bryant, who has become a real Fantasy stud, on a weekly basis. Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/11/00 Hill was activated from the injured list before tonight's game against the Los Angeles Clippers. The former Duke star has missed all but two of Orlando's 20 games this season with an ankle injury. In his only two appearances, Hill averaged 13.5 points, 7.5 rebounds and 6.5 assists per game. He may need a few games to get his feet back under him, but Hill should still produce numbers good enough to warrant a start this week. Kendall Gill , G NJ - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 Gill missed his third consecutive game on Sunday night due to tendinitis in his right knee. He isn't expected to return to the Nets' lineup until Saturday, when the team travels to Atlanta. Gill has been a major disappointment to Fantasy owners early in the season, averaging only 10.5 points per game. It may be time to cut your losses and drop Gill if another viable option is open to you. Chucky Atkins , G DET - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 Atkins suffered a bruised heel during Sunday night's game against the Lakers. He shot just 2-for-10 in only 20 minutes of play. The injury isn't considered serious, and Atkins should return to practice on Tuesday. The Pistons' point guard leads his team in assists (5.2) and is second in scoring (12.8), and does have some value in the world of Fantasy, especially to those owners in deeper leagues. With a three-game week, it may be better to sit Atkins if your roster allows it. Bimbo Coles , G CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 Coles will have a bone scan on Monday and will undergo arthroscopic surgery on his inflamed left knee on Tuesday. Coles, who was placed on the injured list on Nov. 22, was supposed to be activated for Saturday night's game against Atlanta before his knee began bothering him again. The Cleveland reserve has very little Fantasy value, especially on a team with Andre Miller and Brevin Knight. Elton Brand , F CHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/11/00 Brand returned to the court on Saturday night after missing three games with a hyperextended right knee. He scored 23 points in 33 minutes of play in Chicago's 105-81 loss to San Antonio. Fantasy owners who possess the rights to Brand should put him back into their starting lineup when roster changes occur. Derrick Coleman , F CHA - The Rounders Updated 12/11/00 Coleman is set to resume practice on Monday and will have private sessions with a personal trainer to keep his weight down. Coleman, who has been on the injured list since Nov. 18 due to a lack of physical training, had reportedly weighed as much as 297 pounds earlier this fall. The team is hoping to have him back by the end of December. When Coleman does return, only time will tell if he can regain the form that lead his team in rebounding and was second in scoring a year ago. Use caution before picking up Coleman, who has all the talent to become a solid Fantasy player but seems to lack the drive and motivation to be considered a real commodity. Roshown McLeod , F ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 McLeod hopes to return to the Hawks' lineup on Monday after spending over a month on the injured list. McLeod, who had been granted a ""leave"" by the team to deal with the death of his mother, avearged 9.1 points and 2.7 rebounds in seven games this season. He has very little Fantasy value. Eric Snow , G PHI - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/10/00 The 76ers placed Snow on the injured list with a stress fracture in his right ankle. Snow, who plays point guard next to star Allen Iverson, underwent a CT scan Thursday that revealed the stress fracture. He is expected to be out for six to eight weeks.

"HOLIDAY SAFETY REMINDER The holiday season can mean an increased risk of fires and a higher potential for criminal activity due to people taking advantage of convenient downtown shopping and because of the increased number of special events and office parties. We would like to pass along a few safety and security tips from the City of Houston Fire Department and the Houston Police Department. ? Please do not prop open stairwell doors or doors to the freight elevators. This defeats security. ? Use only artificial trees and greenery in decorating your office space. Do not place cut trees or greenery within the building. Cut trees become major fire hazards when they dry out. ? Office parties or the holiday mood may distract you. Be alert for thieves who try to take advantage of the holiday season. Sometimes just having fewer people at work during the holidays creates an opening for thieves. If you see someone that does not appear to belong in your work area, immediately call the Enron Security Console at 713-853-5360. ? Keep your purse or wallet with you at all times or locked away in a drawer or closet. ? If you go shopping, invite a friend to go along. Try not to overload yourself with packages. When you return, lock your gifts away in a safe place. ? Always be aware of your surroundings while in a public area. If things don, t look right, follow your instincts and avoid going into the area. ? When waiting for a ride home after hours, remain inside the building near a card-reader door until you see your ride arrive. ?

Wolkoff, Executive Vice President RE: Implementation of New NYMEX Rule 9.11A (""Give-Up Trades"") DATE: May 7, 2001 =========================================================== Please be advised that beginning on the trade date of Friday, June 1, 2001, new NYMEX Rule 9.11A (""Give-Up Trades"") will go into effect. ! In the absence of an applicable give-up agreement, new Rule 9.11A will define the respective responsibilities/obligations to an order of executing brokers, customers and Clearing Members. ! The term ""executing broker"" as used in Rule 9.11A refers to the registered billing entity, Member Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is transmitted. ! Rule 9.11 will provide that, in the absence of an applicable give-up agreement, a Clearing Member may reject a trade only if: (1) the trade exceeds trading limits established by the Clearing Member for that customer that have been communicated to the executing broker as provided by the rule or (2) the trade is an error for which the executing broker is responsible. ! The new rule also places affirmative obligations on executing brokers to confirm Clearing Member authorization for an account. For example, prior to an executing broker accepting and executing an initial order for any new customer account, such executing broker must confirm with the Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that: (a) the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member; (b) the account number; (c) the brokerage rate; (d) the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with the executing broker for that account; and (e) a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that account. Moreover, the executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or the specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite party, date, time, and any other relevant information. The Compliance Department will conduct periodic audits of such records, and falsification of such information shall be the basis for disciplinary action. If you have any questions concerning this new rule, please contact Bernard Purta, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Operations, at (212) 299- 2380; Thomas LaSala, Vice President, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2897; or Arthur McCoy, Vice President, Financial Surveillance Section, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2928, NEW RULE 9.11A (""Give-Up Trades"") (Entire rule is new.) Rule 9.11A Give-Up Trades In the absence of a give-up agreement whose terms and conditions govern the responsibilities/obligations of executing brokers, customers and Clearing Members, the following rules shall define the respective responsibilities/obligations of those parties to an order. The ""executing broker"", as used in this rule, is the registered billing entity, Member Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is transmitted. (A) Responsibilities/Obligations of Clearing Members (1). Limits Placed by Clearing Member. A Clearing Member may, in its discretion, place trading limits on the trades it will accept for give-up for a customer's account from an executing broker, provided however, that the executing broker receives prior written or electronic notice from the Clearing Member of the trading limits on that account. Notice must be received by the executing broker in a timely manner. A copy of such notice shall be retained by the Clearing Member. (2). Trade Rejection. A Clearing Member may reject (""DK"") a trade only if: (1) the trade exceeds the trading limits established under Section I(A) of this rule for that customer and it has been communicated to the executing broker as described in Subsection (A); or (2) the trade is an error for which the executing broker is responsible. If a Clearing Member has a basis for rejecting a trade, and chooses to do so in accordance with the provisions of Rule 2.21(B), it must notify the executing broker promptly. (3). Billing. A Clearing Member will pay all floor brokerage fees incurred for all transactions executed by the executing broker for the customer and subsequently accepted by the Clearing Member by means of the ATOM system. Floor brokerage fees will be agreed upon in advance among the Clearing Member, customer and the executing broker. (B) Responsibilities/Obligations of Executing Brokers (1) Customer Order Placement. An executing broker will be responsible for determining that all orders are placed or authorized by the customer. Once an order has been accepted, a broker or the broker's clerk must: (a) confirm the terms of the order with the customer; (b) accurately execute the order according to its terms; (c) confirm the execution of the order to the customer as soon as practicable; and (d) transmit such executed order to the Clearing Member as soon as practicable in accordance with Exchange Rules and procedures. 2. Use of Other Persons. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the executing broker is allowed to use the services of another broker in connection with the broker's obligations under these rules. The executing broker remains responsible to the customer and Clearing Member under these rules. 3. Executing Broker Responsibility for Verifying Clearing Member Authorization. Prior to a broker accepting and executing an initial order for any new customer account, the executing broker must confirm with the Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that: (f) the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member; (g) the account number; (h) the brokerage rate; (i) the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with the executing broker for that account; and (j) a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that account. The executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or the specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite party, date, time, and any other relevant information. The falsification of such information shall be the basis for disciplinary action. 4. Rejection of Customer Order. Where an executing broker has confirmed Clearing Member authorization to execute orders on behalf of a customer in accordance with this Rule 9.11A, the broker may, in the broker's discretion, reject an order that the customer transmits to the broker for execution. The broker shall promptly notify the customer and the Clearing Member(s) of any such rejection. Carr Futures 150 S.

"This morning, we announced an offer to acquire London-based MG plc, one of the world,s leading metals marketers, for $446 million. We have been monitoring the global metals market for several years, and we believe that now is the right time to enter this $120 billion market. We are confident that our successful business model, which we have proven in the natural gas and electricity markets, gives us a tremendous advantage in a market that is undergoing fundamental change. Our offer to acquire MG plc has been unanimously recommended by MG plc,s board of directors, and we expect to close the transaction by early third quarter of this year, following shareholder and customary regulatory approvals. MG plc is a leading independent company in global non-ferrous metals trading and marketing and the only such company that is publicly traded. Headquartered in London with major offices in New York and Frankfurt, MG plc has 330 employees in 14 countries. It is the world,s leading copper merchant, one of the top three merchants of copper concentrates and nickel, and a leading European merchant of recycled metal. Other products that MG plc markets include aluminum, lead, tin, zinc, brass and stainless steel. This transaction provides Enron with access to new customers and enables cross-marketing opportunities. We plan to sell Enron energy products to MG plc customers and offer bundled products combining metals and power outsourcing. Enron will help producers and consumers manage the risks inherent in volatile raw materials and energy markets, and we will improve commodity prices for both buyers and sellers. MG plc,s existing market-making capabilities and market knowledge provide an immediate platform upon which to overlay Enron,s proven ability to offer innovative e-commerce-enabled services to commodity-based industries. Our new metals business will be integrated into our wholesale business by Enron Europe CEO John Sherriff, who will work closely with Enron Net Works CEO Greg Whalley.",ham

Latest NFL Player News Corey Bradford , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 After missing most of the season because of a broken leg, Bradford is now recovering from torn cartilage in his right knee. He still hopes to return for a December 10 game against the Lions. Right now he is having trouble pushing off on his knee. Stay away from Bradford in your Fantasy league until next season. Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Eric Bass Updated 11/30/00 Grbac returned to practice on Wednesday and will likely return for Monday night's game against New England. Although he is still listed as questionable on the injury report, Head Coach Gunther Cunningham is optimistic. ""Right now, I'd say he'll play,"" said Cunningham, ""but we'll see what (today) brings."" Since Grbac isn't a definite starter this week, it would be wise to use another quarterback if your roster allows it - especially with the Fantasy playoffs beginning. Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Fear Updated 11/30/00 Smith's injured right hamstring has made significant progress since he missed last week's game against the Colts, and the Dolphins are cautiously optimistic that he could return for this week's game against Buffalo. Despite experiencing a slight ""tweak"" in the hamstring after Wednesday's practice, Smith still believes he will be ready to go. ""I feel fine,"" Smith said, ""I have no pain in my leg. I'm running and cutting without any pain."" Those Fantasy owners with a deep running back rotation, however, would be wise to steer clear of Smith this week. Playing in the cold at Buffalo could hinder Smith's performance, which is a chance you won't want to take at this point of the season. Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - McKay Neal Updated 11/30/00 Contrary to earlier reports, the Dolphins are now ""optimistic"" that Fiedler will be their starting quarterback for this week's game against Buffalo. He took 75 percent of the snaps with the first team during Wednesday's practice and reported that he felt fine. It would be a remarkable recovery for Fielder, who couldn't even raise his right arm on Sunday. ""If he's OK (today), he's starting,"" said Head Coach Dave Wannstedt. Even if he does start, Fielder isn't a very strong option for Fantasy owners who have advanced to their league's playoffs. Curtis Enis , RB CHI - FIBSABs Updated 11/30/00 Enis has vowed to be lighter and mightier next season. Where have we heard this before? During the offseason Enis bulked up to 250 pounds and promised to run over the opposition. He looked slow carrying the ball this season and was replaced at HB by James Allen. With HB Marlon Barnes and Allen in tow, Enis may have to take his leaner physique elsewhere. He is down to 242 pounds already and would like to reach 235. Even if he does reach this goal don't count on him being too productive. Wait and see if he re-emerges as a star before you gamble and put him on your Fantasy team next year. Cade McNown , QB CHI - Top Dogs Updated 11/30/00 McNown is listed as questionable but will be the emergency QB for sunday's game against the Bears, behind Shane Matthews and backup Mark Hartsell. It appears that McNown is done for the Fantasy season. His seperated shoulder rendered him helpless for the latter part of 2000, but even when he was healthy he didn't produce too much. Shaun King , QB TB - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/30/00 King practiced Wednesday and will start Sunday against Dallas. He sat out a workout Monday because of a lower back strain, but said he felt fine after taking most of the snaps as the Bucs began preparations for the Cowboys. King hasn't been too productive in recent weeks and don't expect that to change against Dallas this week. The Cowboys have only allowed 185.5 passing yards per game this season. But King is still one of the better QBs in the league. He may not have a stellar game this Sunday but will be good enough to help your Fantasy team in the playoffs. Wane McGarity , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 McGarity injured his left ankle in practice on Wednesday, leaving him questionable for Sunday's game at Tampa Bay. The Cowboys, who have been devastated by injuries all season long, can ill-afford to lose McGarity, who has become one of their more consistent receivers in recent weeks. Fantasy owners should avoid starting any of Dallas' receivers other than James McKnight for the duration of the season. Chris Greisen , QB ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 With the shoulder injury to backup Dave Brown, Greisen will likely be Arizona's number two quarterback this week against the Bengals. He has only thrown nine passes in three career appearances, but could see some playing time this week if starter Jake Plummer re-aggravates the rib injury that kept him out of last week's game against the Giants. Fantasy owners should avoid Arizona quarterbacks this week at all costs, especially with the playoffs beginning for most leagues. Ricky Williams , RB NO - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00 Williams could be back in time for the final regular season game on December 24. ""There's a chance he can come back,"" coach Jim Haslett said. ""We're kind of shooting for the last game, but hopefully the playoffs."" Most Fantasy leagues will be over by Week 17. But if your team is still playing having Williams will definitely help. Terrell Owens , WR SF - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/30/00 Owens will play this week against the Chargers but at this point he is not healthy enough to take a gamble on. ""I'll definitely play this week,"" said Owens. ""It's all a matter of how much pain I can tolerate."" Owens' toe is purple and swollen, and he can't run at top speed. Don't expect him to put up good numbers this week. Use another receiver instead of Owens if possible. Joe Jurevicius , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 Jurevicius did a good job replacing Ike Hilliard last week, catching six passes for 70 yards in New York's 31-7 win. He will start in place of his injured teammate once again, but don't expect the same type of numbers against the Redskins. It would be wise to use other receivers on your roster this week if possible, especially considering that Jurevicius will probably find himself lined up across from Deion Sanders for most of the day. Amani Toomer , WR NYG - McKay Neal Updated 11/29/00 Toomer accounted for 89 yards of total offense and a touchdown in last Sunday night's 31-7 win over Arizona. He will face off against a talented Redskins' secondary this week that held him to only three catches and 31 yards in the team's first meeting. If your other wideouts have more favorable matchups this week, it might be wise to bench Toomer. Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/29/00 Hilliard will miss his second straight game this week against Washington. He is still suffering from a punishing hit from Lions' safety Kurt Shultz two weeks ago that resulted in a bruised sternum. Joe Jurevicius will replace Hilliard once again. Tiki Barber , RB NYG - The Klap Updated 11/29/00 Barber is having a surprisingly solid Fantasy season. He accounted for 82 yards from scrimmage and a touchdown in last week's win over the Cardinals. The Giants will no doubt continue to use Barber as one of their main offensive threats, so he will always have a chance at being productive. Unless you have a stacked backfield, you could do a lot worse than putting Barber in your starting lineup. Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/29/00 Dayne ran the ball 24 times for 85 yards and a touchdown in last Sunday's win over Arizona. Don't expect those types of numbers this week, however, as the G-Men face off against a Washington squad that will be hungry for a win. In Week Four, the 'Skins held Dayne to only 23 yards rushing, and this week shouldn't be much different. Keep Dayne on your bench if your roster allows it. Kerry Collins , QB NYG - Matt Lenhart Updated 11/29/00 Collins completed 20-of-30 passes for 232 yards and one touchdown in last week's win over Arizona. He has been playing well in recent weeks, throwing eleven touchdown passes in his last five games. He will face off against a tougher opponent this week, namely the Washington Redskins and their fifth ranked pass defense. Collins was unimpressive in the team's first meeting, so you may want to consider benching him this week if your roster allows it. Mike Vanderjagt , K IND - Top Dogs Updated 11/29/00 Vanderjagt missed his only field goal attempt against the Dolphins, a 59-yarder at the end of regulation that would have sent the game into overtime. The miss was his first since Week Two against Oakland. Vanderjagt remains one of Fantasy's best kickers, so continue to start him as you enter your league's playoffs. Marvin Harrison , WR IND - Eric Bass Updated 11/29/00 Harrison only caught four passes last week against Miami - lucky for Fantasy owners that two of them were for touchdowns. He will go up against a Jets' secondary this week that held him to only four catches and 34 yards in Week Ten. It's now time for the playoffs, however, so Harrison should be in your lineup every week until your season ends, one way or another. Edgerrin James , RB IND - Martin Cuilla Updated 11/29/00 ""The Edge"" just keeps on producing, rushing for 118 yards and catching five passes for 37 yards in last week's loss to Miami. He faces the Jets this week, a team he lit up for 131 yards rushing and a touchdown in Week Ten. Indianapolis needs this game to stay in the playoff hunt, and James, as always, will be the Colts' main man on offense. Peyton Manning , QB IND - Tori Kuykendall Updated 11/29/00 Manning completed 16-of-34 passes for 209 yards and two touchdowns in last Sunday's loss to Miami. He will face the Jets this week in New York, which may not be a good sign for Fantasy owners. The Colts haven't faired well in the cold this season, losing on the road to both Chicago and Green Bay. Start Manning this week as always, and hope that he can break away from his team's cold weather misfortunes. Chris Chandler , QB ATL - Hunter Shively Updated 11/29/00 Chandler will be replaced at QB by rookie Doug Johnson for the final three games. The team stated that this move is aimed at allowing Chris Chandler some time to heal his wounds. It will also give them a chance to evaluate Johnson. Considering Atlanta's passing performances it would be wise to avoid picking up Johnson, especially as your team enters the postseason. Keep an eye on him though. If he plays well he may be worth drafting next year. Carl Pickens , WR TEN - The Klap Updated 11/29/00 Pickens tested his hamstring before Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the team decided not to let him play just before gametime. He is close to being ready for a return, but likely needs to get more involved in practice first. ""Carl practiced last week, but we felt and he felt if he had gone out and pushed it a little bit he had that risk factor of reinjuring it,"" said Coach Jeff Fisher. ""I would assume he'd be close to play [Sunday against Philadelphia]."" Don't expect solid Fantasy numbers out of him, however, as he hasn't had a reception since October 1. Troy Edwards , WR PIT - FIBSABs Updated 11/29/00 Edwards impressed Coach Bill Cowher with a 27-yard reception against Cincinnati last Sunday, but he hasn't yet put himself back in the Steelers' receiving picture. As long as Hines Ward continues to play well at flanker, don't expect anything from Edwards over the season's final weeks. Check back with him next season. Doug Johnson , QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 Johnson will start the team's final three games of the season in place of the battered Chris Chandler. Don't expect Johnson to do too much better. He should have a good game against the Seahawks this week, but overall the Falcons receivers don't get open enough. Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Fear Updated 11/29/00 The Steelers have listed Bettis as questionable with a calf injury on their injury report for Sunday's game against Oakland. He has routinely been listed as probable for games this season, yet has played every game. More surprising is that Bettis has performed well in recent weeks despite the absence of center Dermontti Dawson. Dawson has missed three games with a hamstring injury, and is listed as questionable this week, but don't allow his absence to affect your decision on whether to start Bettis. Courtney Hawkins , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 Hawkins will be listed as questionable on the Steelers' injury report for Sunday's game against Oakland. He is expected to play, though, as he was also listed as questionable last Sunday but made the start anyway. If he can't go, then Plaxico Burress, the man Hawkins replaced in the lineup, would probably get the call. Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala , RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 Fuamatu-Ma'afala will miss his sixth straight game on Sunday against Oakland with a broken foot. He is expected to run this week for the first time since he suffered the injury, so he should be able to return by the following week. Don't expect anything out of Fuamatu-Ma'afala over the final weeks, though, as Jerome Bettis has a firm grip on the starting job. Aaron Stecker , RB TB - Free Agent Updated 11/29/00 Stecker is still recovering from a bruised knee and is not expected to play against the Cowboys Sunday. He rarely fields kicks anymore and is used primarily as a blocker on the return team. Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - FIBSABs Updated 11/29/00 Hakim injured his wrist in last Sunday's game against the Saints and is questionable for this week's matchup against the Panthers. If he is unable to play, look for Ricky Proehl to receive extended action as the third receiver. Given Proehl's performance last week in which he caught a TD he might be worth picking up to replace Hakim if you play in a Fantasy league that allows more than two receivers. More Updates Player News?Teams? Eric Bass Player News Lions , Active DT Updated 11/29/00 The Lions' defense will have to pick their poison Thursday when they face the Vikings. Will they double-team Randy Moss or Cris Carter? Or both? What will they do about QB Daunte Culpepper and RB Robert Smith? It may not matter too much if they double-team Moss. He has been known to make catches in double coverage but Carter is a different story. They focused their energies on stopping Carter in the first game and held him to three catches for 30 yards, but Moss had 168 receiving yards and three TDs. Thursday's game could be a long one for the Lions' defense. If you have them hope that they can find a way to contain Minnesota and score some points for your Fantasy team. Elvis Grbac , Active QB Updated 11/30/00 Grbac returned to practice on Wednesday and will likely return for Monday night's game against New England. Although he is still listed as questionable on the injury report, Head Coach Gunther Cunningham is optimistic. ""Right now, I'd say he'll play,"" said Cunningham, ""but we'll see what (today) brings."" Since Grbac isn't a definite starter this week, it would be wise to use another quarterback if your roster allows it - especially with the Fantasy playoffs beginning. Terrell Davis , Reserve RB Updated 11/29/00 An MRI performed on Davis' leg Tuesday showed a ""stress reaction on the mid-lower leg,"" which is a precursor of a stress fracture. He will have his leg placed in a boot for about three weeks to prevent a stress fracture, meaning he will essentially miss the remainder of the regular season. If you have Davis on your Fantasy team and you're not in a keeper league, it's not worth holding onto him at this point. Kimble Anders , Reserve RB Updated 11/29/00 The Kansas City Star says the Chiefs intend to stick with veterans down the stretch. That means Anders will continue to start at halfback over Mike Cloud. Frank Moreau, however, might see tiem at fullback in place of Donnell Bennett and Warren Moon will continue to be the No. 2 QB over Todd Collins. Robert Smith , Active RB Updated 11/27/00 Smith carried 21 times for 148 yards and a touchdown in Thursday's game against the Cowboys. With Marshall Faulk recovering from injury and Edgerrin James struggling, Smith is without a doubt the best Fantasy RB right now. Look for him to have another solid outing against the shaky Lions' run defense this Thursday. Marvin Harrison , Active WR Updated 11/29/00 Harrison only caught four passes last week against Miami - lucky for Fantasy owners that two of them were for touchdowns. He will go up against a Jets' secondary this week that held him to only four catches and 34 yards in Week Ten. It's now time for the playoffs, however, so Harrison should be in your lineup every week until your season ends, one way or another. Donald Hayes , Active WR Updated 11/28/00 Hayes was deactivated for Monday's game against Green Bay with a groin injury. Isaac Byrd, his replacement, had no catches in the game. As long as Hayes remains out, Muhsin Muhammad should be expected to be the focus of the Panthers' passing game, much like he was Monday night. Donovan McNabb , Reserve QB Updated 11/27/00 McNabb was McNasty against Washington, accounting for 262 yards of total offense and two touchdowns in the Eagles' 23-20 win at FedEx Field. He put the offensive unit on his shoulders and single-handedly kept Philadelphia in first place in the NFC East. Up next, McNabb will face a tough Tennessee squad who will no doubt be fired up after losing to the Jaguars. Don't expect huge numbers from McNabb this week, but do expect him to be the focal point of Philadelphia's offense once again. Joe Nedney , Active K Updated 11/09/00 Nedney has made 16-of-17 field goals this season but told the Charlotte Observer that he will play elsewhere next season rather than try to compete with incumbent kicker John Kasay next year. Nedney will be an unrestricted free agent in March and has been filling in for Kasay who tore the ACL in his kicking leg during the preseason. ""It's not that I'm not enjoying my time here,"" said Nedney. ""It's a great scenario to be doing this well, but I was brought in as somebody's replacement - and when that person gets better, he'll be the guy."" Joe Horn , Active WR Updated 11/27/00 Horn was productive once again Sunday catching seven passes for 77 yards. He is still the primary receiver but his numbers could suffer in upcoming weeks. New starter Aaron Brooks spreads the ball around and scrambles more than Jeff Blake. Marcus Robinson , Reserve WR Updated 11/29/00 Not having QB Cade McNown throw to him has really hurt Robinson's numbers. While playing with McNown in his first six games this season, Robinson had 32 receptions for 506 yards (15.8 average) and four touchdowns. In his last five contests, Robinson has just 23 catches for 232 yards (10.1 yards), with one touchdown. Except for one quarter against the Eagles, Jim Miller and Shane Matthews were the quarterbacks in those ballgames. McNown is still another week or so away from playing so look for Robinson to continue to struggle. James Allen , Active RB Updated 11/29/00 Despite his three fumbles on Sunday, Allen remains in the Bears plans for 2001, and why wouldn't he. He is the Bears' starting halfback and leading rusher, gaining 840 yards this season. Allen will be a restricted free agent after this season but Personnel VP Mark Hatley has stated that he would like to bring him back next season. If Allen remains confident he will be a good Fantasy backup next season. Look for him to have a big game this week against a Packers defense that allowed Carolina rookie RB Brad Hoover to run all over them Monday. Sylvester Morris , Reserve WR Updated 11/17/00 Morris is starting to fade after some first-half heroics. He has been very inconsistent and don't be hesitant to bench him at this important point of the season. Ravens , Reserve DT Updated 11/27/00 Although Cleveland scored a touchdown on its opening drive Sunday, becoming the first team to achieve the feat this season, the Ravens' defense posted yet another dominating performance. Foiled in its quest to post its record-tying fifth shutout of the season, Baltimore held the Browns to just seven points and a staggering 112 net yards. The Ravens also had six sacks, an interception and two fumble recoveries in the game. It's probably safe to say that owners of this defense are already playoff-bound. Although Baltimore has its bye week next, Fantasy owners have to be happy to sport this defense during their playoff run, as the team faces weaker offenses San Diego and Arizona coming off the bye.

"---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/11/2000 04:57 PM --------------------------- ""George Richards"" <cbpres@austin.rr.com> on 09/08/2000 05:21:49 AM Please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com> To: ""Phillip Allen"" <pallen@enron.com> cc: ""Larry Lewter"" <retwell@mail.sanmarcos.net> Subject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin that we told you about. As you can tell from the proforma this project should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years. This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for this market. This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we have uncovered to date in the Austin market. The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan. As it is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austin for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete in less than 6 months. Additionally, many of the current and more severe water treatment ordinances have been waived. I have estimated the lot improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street widening. Even though this property is not likely to require street widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond requirement, I used this data to be cautious. The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not expected to impact sales significantly. Other projects have been quite successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University. As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods is uneven. We have included a fence around the entire property, but may only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop. Gated communities are far preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer preferences. The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and an extended escrow. This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan. This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the profits of the project. As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity with your profit in the lot. I believe this would facilitate the use of a 1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then be the equity for that project. You would need to discuss this with an exchange expert first. Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San Antonio if you do not know anyone. I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker, by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery. Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to schedule a tour of the site and the area. Please get back to me as soon as your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any time. You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either 512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110. My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is 512-338-1103. I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you on this project that is sure to be a major winner. I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual events these past few weeks. A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes. One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to start the next day. The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough to knock it down. The City shut down the project for a week and it took another week to get every thing back on tract. Then last week I had to take my wife to emergency. She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this past week.. There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize the enormous number of things she does everyday. Fortunately, it looks as if she will be ok in the long run. George W.

"most bullish thing at this point is moving closer to everyone's psychological $4 price target and that everybody and their dog is still short. next sellers need to be from producer community. saw a little this week with williams hedging the barrett transaction but wouldnt say thats indicative of the rest of the e&p community. short covering rallies will get more common here. velocity of move down has slowed significantly for good (except maybe in bid week). my concern is if we go to $4 and people want to cover some shorts, who's selling it to them? might feel a lot like it did when we were trying to break $5.",ham

"For anyone to fully bury global warming, they would have to bury the Greens. A Green once said that if the Spotted Owl hadn't existed they would have had to invent it. So it is with global warming. Their fundamental opposition isn't to a warmer earth, it is to industrial civilization. The fact that the sattelites didn't match what the global warming theorists said should be there is old news. The news here is that the temperature measures via sattelite have gotten even better and they have been validated with a different means of measurement. Rather than have to defend CO2 concentrations as not causing global warming, people who believe in CO2 need a good explanation of the ""Medieval Warm Period"". Said period was warmer than what we have now, and it obvioiusly wasn't caused by CO2. In point of fact the predicted global warming due to CO2 is not caused DIRECTLY by CO2. CO2 doesn't trap that much heat. Water vapor does, and if you can get more water vapor in the air due to CO2 then you have your warming theory. Yet it would seem that the very stability of the earth's climate over long periods argues not for an unstable system with positive feedback loops but one where negative feedback loops predominate. More water vapor can increase temperatuers, but that also leads to more clouds. Clouds both trap heat and reflect it, so it depends a great deal on how the cloud formation shakes out. Most climate models admit they do clouds very poorly.

"HOUSTON - Enron Corp. hosted its annual equity analyst conference today in Houston. Ken Lay, Enron chairman and chief executive officer, opened the conference by highlighting Enron,s tremendous growth across all businesses and the outstanding 700 percent return to shareholders over the past decade. Enron presented key objectives for 2000: ? Continued strong growth in the core Wholesale Energy businesses. ? Break-out performance from Retail Energy Services. ? Rapid development of Enron Broadband Services. Enron,s ability to extend core skills and competencies to new markets was a recurring theme throughout the day. Wholesale Energy Business Growth prospects remain strong for Wholesale Energy Operations and Services, Enron,s largest business. Wholesale energy growth in North America is expected to be driven by the continuing deregulation of power markets in the United States and large-scale energy outsourcing by utilities and large energy consumers. Enron expects to continue to broaden its early lead across the European continent as markets quickly open to competition. Finally, Enron is rapidly expanding its wholesale presence in other markets such as Japan, where large customers will be permitted to choose their electricity provider in March 2000. EnronOnline will provide additional wholesale growth as incremental sales are generated through this innovative, Internet-based transaction system. Over 450 customers around the world have used EnronOnline and over 10,000 transactions have been completed since its introduction in late November 1999. Yesterday, EnronOnline transaction levels reached a new record with over 700 transactions, representing a notional value of $250 million. Transaction processing costs with EnronOnline are significantly lower than costs associated with traditional transaction methods. Enron,s Gas Pipeline Group is also well positioned to continue growing, with expansions planned or underway on several of its systems. Retail Energy Services With over 16,500 facilities under management, the infrastructure is in place to service customers worldwide. As the strong contracting momentum continues, Enron Energy Services is poised to rapidly increase earnings in 2000. Enron Energy Services, goal for 2000 is to sign new contracts representing $16 billion in future expenditures by customers for energy and energy services, nearly double the level in 1999. Enron Broadband Services The new name of Enron,s communications business, Enron Broadband Services, reflects its role in the very fast growing market for premium broadband services. Enron is deploying an open, flexible global broadband network controlled by software intelligence, which precludes the need to invest in a traditional point-to-point fiber network. This Enron Intelligent Network is widely interconnected to both other wholesale bandwidth carriers and to Internet service providers, thus providing the platform for two new Enron business centers, bandwidth intermediation and broadband content delivery. A direct transfer of Enron,s core market making and risk management skills from its energy businesses, bandwidth intermediation will provide capacity-holders a vast array of alternatives for flexible, low cost capacity. Enron will also provide premium broadband content services, such as high-quality video-streaming and large broadband file transfer, with differentiated levels of quality in a usage-based business model. As announced in a separate release, Enron also reached an agreement with Sun Microsystems that provides for accelerated development of broadband Internet services. Enron is one of the world,s leading electricity, natural gas and communications companies. The company, which owns approximately $34 billion in energy and communications assets, produces electricity and natural gas, develops, constructs and operates energy facilities worldwide, delivers physical commodities and financial and risk management services to customers around the world, and is developing an intelligent network platform to facilitate online business. Enron,s Internet address is www.enron.com, and the stock is traded under the ticker symbol, &ENE.8 ## This press release includes forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Although Enron believes that its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that its goals will be achieved. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements herein include political developments in foreign countries, the ability to penetrate new wholesale and retail natural gas, electricity and broadband services markets, including the energy outsource market, in the United States and Europe, the timing and extent of changes in prices for crude oil, natural gas, electricity and those relating to broadband services and content, the timing and effect of changes in interest rates, the timing and success of Enron,s efforts to develop domestic and international power, pipeline, communications, internet-related and other infrastructure projects, and conditions of the capital markets and equity markets during the periods covered by the forward looking statements.",ham

"---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 02/02/2001 04:43 PM --------------------------- From: Phillip K Allen 02/02/2001 02:40 PM To: stagecoachmama@hotmail.com cc: Subject: Lucy, Please fix #41 balance by deleting the $550 in the ""Rent Due"" column. The other questions I had about last week's rent are: #15 Only paid 95 of their 190 on 1/19 then paid nothing on 1/26. What is going on? #25 Looks like she was short by 35 and still owes a little on deposit #27 Switched to weekly, but paid nothing this week. Why? I spoke to Jeff Smith. I think he was surprised that we were set up with email and MSN Messenger. He was not trying to insult you. I let Jeff know that he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see the property. Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without Jeff and you can show them around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is. Regarding the raise, $260/week plus the apartment is all I can pay right now. I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meet but I think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair. As Gary and Wade continue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve the property's tenants and reputation. The apartments are looking better and better, yet the turnover seems to be increasing. Remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants. It is hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people move in that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests. I realize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor and your daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and be working in the office or on the property during office unless you are running an errand for the property. I am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at this time. We can look at again later in the year. I will talk to you later or you can email or call over the weekend. Phillip",ham

"A conference call was held today with FERC staffers to discuss items of interest or concern to us. Participating for FERC were Bob Pease (enforcement att'y), Stuart Fisher (economist) and Bruce Poole (engineer). Alan Comnes, Dave Perrino and I weighed in for Enron. The laundry list of topics discussed is attached. We expressed the sentiment that the root cause of all these issues and concerns is the current composition (and non-independence) of the ISO board, and suggested that the ISO board situation should be the subject of the upcoming FERC audit of ISO. We went on to discuss the audit further and the fact that there is no established or formal comment process. However, we were invited to file written comments with the Commission on what we thought should be audited, and Alan is taking the lead on this. We will try to get others to sign on to the comments. Some of the discussion items that the staff was highly interested in included: ISO request for a bid from us to prop up the price (staff requested a copy of the transcript). Any unexplained decreases in ATC (staff asked to be advised in real time). Information related to ISO OOM purchases (and whether they were declining). All in all, it was a successful, informal call lasting about 40 minutes. Staff was receptive to and agreed to receive periodic calls from us in the future. This allows them to keep up with what is going on industry, and of course gives us an opportunity to educate and alert them on issues of interest to us. Ray",ham

"? Hi Folks, I gotta say before I get started that Monday Night Football,s &Pack"" and ""Cats8 in the scoring box was one of the more annoying moves they,ve made this season.? &Cats8?? That,s so lame. Enough of that, let's jump right into our Upgraded and Downgraded Players.? As we head down the home stretch, identifying those players moving up or down can be the difference between making the playoffs or watching from the sidelines.? As we head into our 14th week of listing these players, it,s inevitable that some players will have made both the upgrade or downgrade list.? Make sure you understand, what we,re talking about is players that are moving.? In other words, a player like TE Chad Lewis could appear on the downgrade list and still be good enough to be a starter in your league.? It just means I,m concerned about the way he seems to be heading.? Likewise, a player like WR Willie Jackson may make the upgrade list even though he,s still fairly far down the list of WRs.? It,s all about which direction players are moving.? Keeping an eye on these trends can very often make all the difference. Joe ? Upgrades and Downgrades.? Some of these players are obvious moves up or down and some aren't as clear.? Here's my list of guys I see moving this week. QBs Moving Up? QB Kordell Stewart (Pit)? Time to give props where props are due.? Kordell looks like a new man.? Actually, he looks like the old Kordell.? The GOOD old Kordell. Over the last three weeks, he ranks as the # 5 QB in my Performance / TD system based on FF points per game.? Gotta hand it to Bill Cowher as it took some guts to bench the starting? WRs like that but Hines Ward has delivered.? It,s probably not the best thing for Jerome Bettis owners but Stewart,s 3 rushing TDs over the last 3 weeks are huge.? QB Aaron Brooks (NO)? Brooks made my upgrade list last week and I put my money where my mouth was outbidding the other owners in my league to pick him up? last week as a free agent.? I said last week that we,d see how he does with the pressure on all week.? Obviously, this is one cool kid.? If you saw the footage of him in the tunnel before the game he looked like he was ready to go out and play a game of flag football or something.? He made some mistakes and fought back from adversity several times.? The obvious comparison is a young Randall Cunningham.? He,s skinny and has a little bit of those Cunningham crazy legs.? Plus he,s got a big arm with that whippy motion.? But the biggest thing that impresses me about Brooks is his poise.? Grab him if he,s available in your league.? I asked my friend Tony Pauline from the TFY Draft Preview about Brooks.? Tony had him ranked higher than Shaun King before the draft. Here,s what the 1999 TFY Draft Preview had for Brooks:? AARON BROOKS Virginia 6'3"" 210 4.71 Fifth year senior who completed 54% of his passes throwing for 2,319 yards, 12 touchdowns and nine interceptions and carrying the ball 83 times for 232 yards, averaging 2.8 yards per carry with five more scores.? Led the ACC in passing efficiency two seasons ago, throwing for 57% / 2,282 / 20 / 7.? Good athlete who has shown great improvement in his quarterback skills the last season and a half.? Smooth and fluid, sets his feet in the pocket, shows good strength and stands his ground when being rushed.? Has a live arm; can thread a needle, throws ropes and his deep passes have speed.? Effective throwing on the run, squares his shoulders and quickly releases the ball. Eludes or side steps oncoming rushers, pulls the ball down, running between the tackles.? While he has improved his accuracy and places his passes well, he often overthrows receivers.? The further down the field or out to the flanks he must get the ball, the more his accuracy struggles.? Must do a better job reading and recognizing defenses, stop staring down his primary target and not hold the ball so long while in the pocket.? A player who turned himself into a good prospect with a solid senior campaign.? Mid to late Sixth Round.? Thanks Tony.? Be sure to check out Tony,s great info at www.TFYDraftPreview.com? QB Kurt Warner? (StL)?? Warner,s chomping at the bit and has been named the starter this week relieving Trent Green.? Keep an eye out on how he looks in practice.? Coach Mike Martz said last week he was concerned about Warner,s grip strength and ability to put rotation on the ball.? I,m thinking he,ll be good to go.? QB? Donovan McNabb (Phi)? What else can you say about this guy?? Take away his running game?? No problem.? Give him WRs that would? struggle to make a division I team? ?No problem.? He finds a way to get it done.? He looks to me like he,s beginning to reach the level of dominance he enjoyed at Syracuse where he was unstoppable.? It,s especially impressive as teams know what he,s going and still can,t stop him.? It should be noted that LaVarr Arrington was injured early and he was the designated &spy8 but still, it was an impressive performance against a very good Washington defense.? I see little reason why he won,t continue although he really needs help at WR.? QB Trent Dilfer (Bal)? I said a couple of weeks ago that Dilfer might play the late season 1999 Tony Banks role as coach Brian Billick revives another struggling? QB,s career.? Dilfer seems very comfortable with what Billick is asking him to do and brings a little fire and attitude to the offense that had been missing.? I like what they,re doing and don,t see why it won,t continue.? Although don,t forget they,re off this week. QB Brad Johnson (Was)? Jeff George yields to the young man from Florida State.? His knee is reportedly good to go and he,s been cleared by the trainers as fit to start.? Considering the troubles the team endured with George at the helm, Johnson has already been named the starter.? He,ll be working with a nicked WR corps so we,ll see how he fares.? QB Ryan Leaf (SD)? Kordell Stewart, Trent Dilfer and Ryan Leaf?? You gotta be kidding me.? But after another solid outing, you can,t deny Leaf is making plays.? Granted, he still throws the ugly interception(s) and he gets hurt almost as much as Rob Johnson but the kid could make a difference for you if you need a spot QB.? He,s got one of the top 3 TEs in the game with Freddie Jones and Curtis Conway and Jeff Graham are veterans who can make a difference.? This win will have to buoy the spirits and enthusiasm. ?? RBs Moving Up? RB Mike Anderson (Den)? Once is a coincidence.? Twice is a trend. You,ve got to start handing credit to Mike Shanahan, Offensive Coordinator Gary Kubiak, and that offensive line. Like everyone else, I marveled at the way Olandis Gary was able to run last year when Terrell Davis went down.? What a great job of scouting we all thought.? But hey, Gary was a pretty highly touted back.? But Mike Anderson???? Anderson,s a fine back but I,ve got to believe it,s a team deal here.? The good news is that Anderson,s team isn,t going anywhere without him and he looks to remain a factor while Terrell Davis recovers from the mystery lower leg ailment.? Watch this during the week, but it wouldn,t surprise me a bit to see Davis miss another game. ?And as long as Anderson rolls up 195 rushing yards a game like he did Sunday, you won,t see Shanahan crying over TD being out.? Granted 80 of those yards came on one big run but he had a great game any way you slice it.? RB Jamal Lewis (Bal)? I,ve been eating crow (Raven?) for a while now as I was one of those guys not convinced Jamal Lewis would excel at this level after a very disappointing 1999 season at Tennessee.? Lewis is running like he did as a Freshman and Sophomore before the knee injury and he may have the best blend of speed and power in the league this side of Eddie George.? Coach Brian Billick has the Raven offense firing on all cylinders and Lewis remains a huge part of it.? His only down side is that he,s off this week with a bye.? But that week 16 matchup against Arizona is looking very tasty(? RB Corey Dillon (Cin)? Considering what he does with that surrounding cast, I could make a strong case that Corey Dillon is the best back in the NFL.? There have been few passing attacks in recent memory as impotent as the Bengals, yet Dillon continues to pound out the yards when defenses know exactly what,s coming at them.? It,s amazing to watch.? I don,t know how long he can keep it up but he,s got the woeful Cardinals this week and you have to like that.? RB Warrick Dunn (TB)? Dunn made the upgrade list last week in the wake of Mike Alstott,s knee injury and he delivered in a big way for his owners Sunday with 129 total yards including 2 TDs.? There was some talk about him sharing carries but he was the only guy besides QB Shaun King to run the ball for Tampa Bay.? Look for more of the same from the Bucs and new offensive coordinator Warren Sapp(? Seriously, Dunn showed he could handle 20 rushing attempts and I think you,ll continue to see them go with what,s working.? RB Michael Pittman (Ari)? Pittman may be the lone bright spot on the Arizona team.? I told you last week that coach McGinnis loves the guy and you saw the results last night as Pittman rambled for 77 yards on only 13 carries (5.7 ypc)? Like Corey Dillon, the surrounding team kills his value but if he ran for a team that held a lead, he,d be awesome.? Unfortunately, I don,t see Arizona turning into such a team anytime soon so don,t get too excited.? But overall, I like the guy a lot.? RB Richie Anderson (NYJ)? Each year, there are always unheralded guys who post nice numbers but remain well below the radar of many owners.? Many times they are RBs who quietly post yardage (and FF points) receiving the ball.? Anderson is a prime example of one such player this year (as?are Tony Richardson and Stanley Pritchett)? He,s caught 15 passes over the last 3 games and with Curtis Martin nursing a sore gluteus maximus, that trend will likely continue.??? RB Robert Holcombe (StL)? It doesn,t take a rocket scientist to see that Marshall Faulk isn,t 100%.? Red flags went up across the country when Mike Martz elected to give Holcombe that shot at the goalline Sunday.? 6 weeks ago, that would have been Faulk,s carry all day long.? Holcombe looks to benefit if Faulk,s workload continues to be decreased.? RB Brad Hoover (Car)? Aside from having one of those cool names the fans can yell whenever he does something good, Hoover has shown to be a capable replacement for candybone Tshimanga Biakabutuka.? He doesn,t have the physical tools of a Biakabutuka but you can,t deny he hasn,t been effective.? It wouldn,t surprise me a bit to see Hoover continue to see action. ?? WRs Moving Up WR Marvin Harrison (Ind)? Harrison stated before Sunday,s game that he needed to &get on a mission8.? Looked like he started towards that end with 2 TD catches and he could have had another.? Yes, you,d like to see more than 4 catches but I,ll take 2 TDs any week.? Harrison,s biggest worry is that Peyton Manning can stay calm enough not to strangle Jerome Pathon for dropping easy balls.? Harrison is fine and actually looking better in my eyes.? WR Hines Ward (Pit)? Does anyone else find it interesting to see Kordell Stewart throwing the ball to another &slash8 type player in Hines Ward?? Ward doesn,t have the name of a Plaxico Burress but he,s certainly more productive.? If I,m Burress, I,d be for finding a baseball cap that I was comfortable with(? WR Amani Toomer (NYG)? Toomer,s back in a big way.? He had us worried there for a stretch earlier but he,s playing very well right now, especially with Ike Hilliard out.? QB Kerry Collins has settled into a nice rhythm and coach Jim Fassell is sticking his neck out guaranteeing a playoff slot.? Look for?Toomer and Collins to be a big part of making that happen. WR Sean Dawkins (Ind)? With his size (6, 48 / 218 #) I,ve always wondered why he isn,t better.? He,s showing over the last few games that maybe he is.? Over the last 3 games, he rates as the # 5 WR in Fantasy Points per game.? It doesn,t seem to make a great deal of difference to him whether it, s Jon Kitna or Brock Huard throwing the ball, he just delivers.??? WR Peter Warrick (Cin)Garbage time or not, he scored another TD this week and he,s a great gamble if you need to roll the dice for a home run.? Yes, he,s as liable to go 2 for 18 as he is score a TD but sometimes, those are the kinds of gambles that pay big.? The team reportedly was forcing him to see an eye doctor for contact lenses.? This could be like Charlie Sheen in Major League with the new glasses.? Seriously, if he,s had bad vision that,s been limiting him, look out once he gets the contacts.? WR Joe Jurevicius (NYG)? With Ike Hilliard out, Jurevicius got all he ever wanted ) a chance.? And he,s making the most of it.? He,s clearly the #2 WR behind Toomer but when this offense is clicking, the #2 guy has definite value.? Keep an eye on Hilliard,s return but he could be a nice sub if you, re in a pinch.? WR Willie Jackson (NO)? Jackson is looking less &fluky8 with each game.?? He put together a nice day Sunday with 4 catches for 64 yards.? Like Jurevicius, he,s the clear cut # 2 receiver but he,s certainly valuable.? QB Aaron Brooks has surprised everyone and Jackson should continue to benefit.? WR R. Jay Soward (Jac)? I,ll be honest, I really don,t like Soward much but you can,t dismiss the fact Mark Brunell seemed to almost be forcing the ball to him on the long throws.? He,ll draw the weaker coverage (and rightly so) when Jimmy Smith and Keenan McCardell are in the lineup so he could have some mismatches.? ?? TEs Moving Up? TE Freddie Jones (SD)? Jones is still under the radar of a few owners as he plays for the Chargers.? Truth is,? he,s one of the better receivers in the game and definitely the best receiver in San Diego.? He,s a nice big target with soft hands for new QB Ryan Leaf.? He,s had 11 receptions over the last 3 games.? TE Jay Reimersma (Buf)? Reimersma,s returning to the player we knew he could be.? With 5 receptions for 82 yards Sunday, he,s a vital part of the offense. ?With WRs Peerless Price and Jeremy McDaniel not doing much, it,s pretty much Eric Moulds and Reimersma. TE David LaFluer (Dal)? With Jackie Harris nursing a sprained knee, LaFluer seized the opportunity and put together an excellent game with 6 catches for 45 yards and a TD.? Keep an eye on Harris but this could be a trend. TE Anthony Becht (NYJ)? Becht earns the upgrade just for the beautiful diving TD catch Sunday.? At this point in the season, rookies aren,t really rookies any more as most have enough experience that they,re learning the ropes.? Becht appears to be a fast learner and could give this team a huge boost with solid TE play. ?? QBs Moving Down? QB Jeff George (Was)? Audition time is over.? Didn't you have the feeling owner Danny Snyder would have loved for his pet QB George to go wild before Brad Johnson sits down to the negotiating table to talk about next year (if they ever do that)? Instead, he looked very average and even a little bit old.? Brad Johnson will get the start this week.? You never know with knee injuries so George certainly still has value, just nothing like he did as a starter. QB Trent Green (StL)? Chris Berman made a great point last night on ESPN,s Prime Time.? Trent Green is a nice player but let,s forget this talk about him being the same player as Kurt Warner.?? Another loss for the Rams pretty much guaranteed we,ll see Warner this week.? The Rams are suddenly fighting for their lives and it won,t be Green behind center.? QB Shane Matthews (Chi)? The University of Florida has a great program and always places a large number of players at the next level but Matthews looks to be another shot putting QB that simply can,t deliver the ball at this level.? It,s a testament to coach Steve Spurrier that he can devise systems to make guys like Matthews and Danny Wuerffel look great in college because they clearly lack the talent.? Put it this way, Matthews has Bears fan wishing Cade McNown will get back soon( QB Drew Bledsoe (NE)? Whether it,s the thumb or the WRs or the play calling, Bledsoe is struggling.? I used to blame this on Bill Belichick coming up with a Jets defense that shattered Bledsoe,s confidence and threw him into a tailspin this time of year but now I,ll have to start looking for other theories.?? As Terry Glenn said, & it felt like the defense knew exactly what we were going to do8.? That,s bad for a Thursday game. ?? RBs Moving Down? RB Emmitt Smith? (Dal)? As you probably saw, Emmitt was knocked out for a moment during the Thanksgiving Day game.? Check his status this week.? Even 100%, he faces a tough stretch of games to finish the season against Tampa Bay, Washington, New York Giants, and Tennessee.? RB J.J. Johnson (Mia)? Johnson had a nice game Sunday but early indications are that Lamar Smith will be ready to play this week and that means Johnson takes a seat.? RB Jamal Anderson (Atl)? It looks to me like the Falcons are very close to packing it in.? He may be worth one more start against the porous Seattle defense this week but after that, he,s got a bye and then New Orleans.? RB Marshall Faulk (StL)? Understand, he,s still a top RB, but I think his value is clearly falling a bit.? He looks less than 100% but the most telling indicator by far was the Robert Holcombe goalline carry.? 6 weeks ago, no way does Holcombe get that carry.? He,s still a must start and Warner will likely help his stock but I,m a little worried.? RB Curtis Martin (NYJ)? The weather conditions made it tough to get a true picture of Martin,s health but it was pretty easy to see he wasn,t 100% Sunday.? Between Bernie Parmalee and Richie Anderson, coach Al Groh has plenty of options and he doesn,t hesitate to go with them.? RB Jermaine Fazande (SD) ?The big guy yields to Terrell Fletcher and looks to have lost his starting job.? Not a huge loss as I doubt you were counting on him for too much anyway. ?? WRs Moving Down? WR Yancey Thigpen (Ten)? Drop this guy if you haven,t already.? He misses games with a myriad of injuries and when he does see the field, he manages to drop key passes(? WR Marcus Robinson (Chi)? One has to wonder what could have been with Jim Miller healthy.? Shane Matthews managed to get the ball to his best WR a whopping one time Sunday.? That will not do.? WR Sylvester Morris (KC)? Morris has been especially disappointing as one usually expects rookies to progress during the season but he seems to be going the other way.? Over the last 3 weeks, he ranks as the # 81 WR in my TD / Performance system.? Part of that can be attributed to Elvis Grbac / Warren Moon but he,s not playing well right now.? WR Terance Mathis (Atl)? Mathis ranks # 72 among WRs over the last 3 games in my TD / Performance system.? That,s not what you,re looking for from a # 1 WR, even if it is the Falcons.??? Eagle WRs? These guys are just not very good.? I had especially high hopes for Charles Johnson this year but he,s not getting it done.??? WR Wayne Chrebet (NYJ)? As sick as I was of Keyshawn Johnson whining about Chrebet not being a #1 WR, it looks he may have had a point.? Chrebet just doesn,t have the speed or physical size to make a? consistent impact when defenses choose to take him out of the game.? I love the guy and admire his grit and determination but he struggles against double coverage.? And most # 1 WR face double coverage(? ? TEs Moving Down TE Andrew Glover (NO)? A rising tide is supposed to lift all boats but nobody told Glover about that little axiom.? The Saints continue to roll in spite of a virtually non existent TE.? TE Jackie Harris (Dal)? Keep an eye on Harris as he sprained a knee Sunday and gave way to David LaFluer catching a ton of passes.? TE Ricky Dudley (Oak)? He,s maybe the most frustrating player in the game.? As soon as you bench him, he,ll catch 2 TDs but I don,t know how many more 1 reception days I can take from this guy.?

Our group, Global Strategic Sourcing Business Development, is now working with Corestaff from a cross-sell prospective. Corestaff has a contract with MCI for broadband services that will be coming up this year for renegotiation. In the coming month, we would like to facilitate a meeting with the EBS contacts you determine and the Corestaff IT contacts.

Colleen Koenig Analyst Global Strategic Sourcing, Business Development 713.345.5326 ----- Forwarded by Colleen Koenig/NA/Enron on 12/18/2000 05:15 PM ----- Cindy Olson Executive VP Human Resources & Community Relations Sent by: Enron Announcements 12/12/2000 06:50 PM To: All Enron Employees United States cc: Subject: Improved Process for Engaging Temporary Workers Cindy Olson Executive VP Human Resources & Community Relations As you are aware, Enron utilizes temporary staffing services to satisfy staffing requirements throughout the company. For the past several months, a project team, representing Enron,s temporary staffing users, have researched and evaluated alternative Managed Services programs to determine which source would best meet our current and future needs in terms of quality, performance and cost containment objectives. The Business Unit Implementation Project Team members are: Laurie Koenig, Operations Management, EES Carolyn Vigne, Administration, EE&CC Linda Martin, Accounting & Accounts Payable, Corporate Beverly Stephens, Administration, ENA Norma Hasenjager, Human Resources, ET&S Peggy McCurley, Administration, Networks Jane Ellen Weaver, Enron Broadband Services Paulette Obrecht, Legal, Corporate George Weber, GSS In addition, Eric Merten (EBS), Kathy Cook (EE&CC), Carolyn Gilley (ENA), Larry Dallman (Corp/AP), and Diane Eckels (GSS) were active members of the Selection Project Team. As a result of the team,s efforts, we are pleased to announce the beginning of a strategic alliance with CORESTAFF,s Managed Services Group. This group will function as a vendor-neutral management entity overseeing all staffing vendors in the program scope. They will also provide a web based online technology tool that will enhance the ordering and reporting capabilities. The goal of our alliance with CORESTAFF is to make obtaining a temporary worker with the right skills and experience easier while protecting the best interests of the organization. We plan to implement Phase I of this improvement effective January 2, 2001. This Phase I of the implementation will encompass administrative/clerical temporary workers at the Houston locations only. If you currently have administrative/clerical temporary workers in your department, the enhancement will not affect their position. In an effort to preserve relationships, all current staffing vendors will be invited to participate in this enhanced program. CORESTAFF shares our commitment to minimize any disruptions in service during this transition. We expect to incorporate the administrative/clerical workers in Omaha, Seattle and Portland in Phase II, which is scheduled for February, 2001. The scope and timing of any additional phases will be determined after these two phases have been completed. Realizing the impact that the temporary workforce has in business today, we selected CORESTAFF,s Managed Services Group based on their exceptional management team, commitment to quality service, and creative solutions to our staffing needs. The relationship promises to offer Enron a cost effective and simple means for obtaining temporary employees. In the coming weeks, Enron and CORESTAFF,s Managed Services Group will be communicating to Enron,s administrative/clerical temporary staffing vendors about the new process. There are many benefits to this new Managed Services program, which are outlined on the attached page. More details on how to utilize CORESTAFF,s Managed Services program will be announced soon and meetings will be scheduled to demonstrate the reporting system and to meet the Managed Services team. What is Managed Services? CORESTAFF,s Managed Services program includes: ? Vendor-neutral management model ? Equal distribution of staffing orders to all staffing partners ? Web-based application with online ordering, data capture and customized reporting ? Benchmarking and performance measurement for continuous improvement ? Methodologies for accurate skill-matching and fulfillment efficiencies Key Benefits ? More vendors working on each order from the outset ) faster access to available talent pools ? Standardized mark-ups and fees to manage costs more effectively ? Online access to requisition status for users ? Robust databases offering managers enhanced tracking and reporting of temporary usage and expenditures ? Standard and customized reporting capabilities -- online ?

"Crash and burn Louisville courtship of Rockets in jeopardy June 13, 2000 1:42 p.m. ET Associated Press HOUSTON * The bid by Louisville, Ky., to land the Houston Rockets appears to have fallen through. Jefferson County in Kentucky on Monday declined to join a three-pronged proposal that would publicly finance a downtown basketball arena. The plan suggested the city, county and state each issue up to $30 million in bonds to cover a portion of an arena that could cost $220 million. The arena would be built to attract the Rockets or another professional basketball team. Team officials visited with Louisville business and government leaders last month. The Rockets have also been in negotiations with Baltimore, New Orleans and St. Louis, but Louisville was the only city to publicly court the team. City officials wanted to submit a proposal to the Rockets by Tuesday, but the county indicated it wasn't ready to participate in the plan, the Houston Chronicle reported Tuesday. ""Please do not issue any statements of commitment, or send a memorandum of understanding at this time on behalf of the county,"" Jefferson County Judge/Executive Rebecca Jackson wrote in a letter that was delivered to Louisville Mayor David Armstrong. The letter, dated Monday, was also signed by the county's three commissioners. The Rockets declined comment on the development, but denied ever giving Louisville attorney J. Bruce Miller a deadline to submit a proposal. Meanwhile Monday, about 35 protesters chanted ""don't pick our pockets to pay for the Rockets!"" in front of the county courthouse in Louisville to protest spending public money on an arena. The Rockets have been considering a move since November, when voters in Houston rejected a plan to build them a $160 million arena.",ham

"Harry: Long time no hear. I can imagine you must be pretty busy these days. So how is the summer shaping up. Are u guys going on a vacation this last week before the Fall term starts? Enron has been in the news quite a lot recently. Jeff Skilling's leaving the company was quite a shocker. As for me, I finally received my H1-B visa. As you know I am currently living temporarily with my sister in NJ and am moving to Boston Sept 1. I had a few questions to ask you and also take u up on your offer of helping me with the GC processing. 1) Do I have to goto Vancouver to get my H1-B visa from the US consulate in Vancouver. I had given my Vancouver address on my visa application and the notice from INS says the the Vancouver consulate is the one that will process my visa. I was wondering since I am in NJ, I could drive down to TO or Ottawa easily. 2) Can you give me the contact details of the lawyer you used for the GC under the E-11 category and also how much would she charge for the GC application. Also what do i have to gather in terms of documents and also do I have to get a letter from the employer? Say my hello to your parents and Nicole. Hope to hear from you soon.

"Thanks. I know the lawyers are concerned about their fate. -----Original Message----- From: Anderson, Diane Sent: Tuesday, November 27, 2001 1:00 PM To: Bailey, Susan Subject: interesting Sizable staff of 245 lawyers in merger limbo HOUSTON (AP) - The fate of Enron Corp.'s massive legal staff has been a subject of discussion amid talk of possible layoffs at the troubled energy trader. The company's legal staff size is larger than some law firms. ""We've always regarded them as one of the big law firms in Houston,"" said Howard Ayers, managing partner of Andrews&Kurth, one of the city's largest with about 240 lawyers in Houston. Enron has about 245 lawyers worldwide, company spokesman Vance Meyer said. With about 145 lawyers in Houston, if it were a private firm it would have been the city's sixth-largest, according to the Chronicle. Enron's internal law office has grown along with the huge trading firm, now set to merge with smaller but stronger Dynegy. As Enron's stock plummeted further, Dynegy last week denied rumors it might drop out and leave Enron to face possible bankruptcy. Speculation in the legal community runs the gamut from rumors that dozens of lawyers could be laid off as early as this week to the idea that Enron will hold on tightly to its talent. ""My guess is they'll need their lawyers while they get things in a more steady state. There's a lot of legal work to go through,"" said Joel Swanson, a senior partner at Baker&Botts, a law firm with about 265 lawyers in Houston. In addition to Enron's in-house legal staff, the company also has hired just about every large firm in Houston over the last few years.",ham

"I am delurking to comment on the Salon article. I just wanted to say that I am grateful they choose not to publish my forbidden thought. I sent it in a couple of days before the 9/11 commeration. If I had just watched the sentimental network and cable shows on 9/11 my cynical thoughts would have remain unchanged. However, I watch the Frontline show ""Faith and Doubt at Ground Zero"" on PBS. That show tackled head on, with much more courage than I have seen elsewhere, the larger questions about good and evil, about art as an alternate religion (Karlheinz Stockhausen -- 9/11 was a great work of art), and especially the question about how religion has a darker side which when carried to fanatic extremes tends to negate the humanity of the non-believers. I am not a religious person but I stunned at the scope of this program. It talked about the Lutheran minister who spoke at Yankees Stadium on a podium with other religious leaders present who was charged with heresy by his own church for promoting the idea that all religions are equal (presumably the Lutherans have the one true path?). Thanks for listening, I just felt like I needed to put the word out about this program. My shallow comment on Salon and others like it (my boyfriend and I had sex while the towers collapsed) gives me pause about how some of us tend to harden ourselves to the suffering of others.

Head coach Paul Westphal decided to go with Ellison in hopes of preventing turnovers. McCoy was behind former backup Ruben Wolkowyski but is now the last man in a five-player rotation. McCoy is a good shot-blocker and a solid rebounder but his lack of offensive skills has hurt his push for playing time. Pervis Ellison , F SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 Ellison is questionable for Thursday's game at Charlotte due to a case of the flu. He served as Ewing's backup in Wednesday's game at Miami. ""Never Nervous"" Pervis entered the game at the end of the first quarter and promptly grabbed a rebound and scored. He did not return after the first quarter, suffering from flu-like symptoms. Vonteego Cummings , G GS - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/09/00 Cummings will be out for at least a month after suffering a fractured cheekbone. He had plastic surgery performed on the cheekbone earlier this week. Vinny Del Negro will be the backup point guard in his absence. Walt Williams , G HOU - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 Williams says he is ready to play in Thursday's game against Vancouver. He missed Tuesday's game against the Lakers because of a sprained left knee. He injured the knee when he landed awkwardly on it Sunday against Phoenix. Antonio McDyess , F DEN - The Rounders Updated 11/09/00 McDyess played only 11 minutes in the second half of Wednesday's game against the Timberwolves due to a stiff back. He finished the game with 11 points. This seems like it will be an ongoing situation with McDyess. It is not known whether he will play in Thursday's game at Portland. Monitor his situation closely. Terry Porter , G SA - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 It appears that the cagey veteran is out of the Spurs' regular rotation. Porter has played a total of 24 minutes this season. His minutes have gradually decreased since the start of the season and he hasn't played in the last two games. It seems that Steve Kerr is now ahead of Porter in the rotation of reserve guards. Jaren Jackson , G SA - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 Reserve swingman Jaren Jackson is suffering from an ankle injury and is listed as day-to-day. He sat out Wednesday's game against the Lakers. Shaquille O'Neal , C LAL - The Rounders Updated 11/09/00 Someone must have slipped ""The Man of Steel"" some kryponite before Wednesday's game against the Spurs. Shaq grabbed 17 rebounds but only scored 13 points. He still put up decent Fantasy numbers but had a bad game in terms of points. No need for Fantasy owners to panic, he should score easily in upcoming games against Denver and Houston. Brian Grant , F MIA - The Rounders Updated 11/09/00 Grant had a monster game against the Sonics Wednesday scoring 30 points and grabbing 21 rebounds. He is doing his best to fill the void left in the middle by Alonzo Mourning. So far Grant isn't doing a bad job, averaging 20.0 points and 13.5 rebounds per game. Desmond Mason , F SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 Mason had four points in Seattle's 87-81 loss to the Heat Wednesday. He beat out Brent Barry for the starting shooting guard job in the preseason but is averaging a mere 4.6 points per game and is shooting 32 percent from the field. Barry is currently suffering from a sprained ankle and hasn't played yet this season but he may get his job back when he returns. Danny Fortson , F GS - Farragut Academy Updated 11/09/00 Fortson continued his exceptional play this season by grabbing 14 rebounds and scoring 17 points against the Kings Wednesday. He has exceeded the expectations of many this season averaging 15.8 points and 15.0 rebounds per game. With numbers like that he is definitely a keeper in any Fantasy league. Predrag Stojakovic , F SAC - Fear Updated 11/09/00 Stojakovic continued his excellent play in the early part of the season by scoring 27 points in Wednesday's game. He is averaging 18 ppg so far, a major increase from his 11.9 average in 1999-2000. Jason Williams , G SAC - Tribe Called PLove Updated 11/09/00 Williams dazzled the Sacramento crowd and his opposition Wednesday by dishing out 12 assists in his first game back from a league induced suspension. He was suspended for the first five games of the season for failing to comply with his drug treatment plan. Williams appeared to be in great shape and is ready to be a Fantasy star this year. Damon Jones , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 Jones played in Wednesday's game at Dallas after suffering a concussion on Monday. He scored five points and had three assists. Chris Childs , G NY - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 Childs left Wednesday's game against the Cavaliers with a bruised right hamstring. He limped to the locker room with his leg heavily wrapped in ice. No timetable on his return has been reported. Kendall Gill , G NJ - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 Gill left Wednesday night's game against the Wizards in the first half after feeling some pain in his knee. He has had a variey of injuries early in the season, including suffering a scratched cornea and dealing with back spasms. Despite the soreness in his knee, Gill doesn't expect to miss any court time, and should play in tonight's game against the Pistons. Ben Wallace , F DET - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 Wallace fell awkwardly on his left leg after being fouled by Sixers' forward George Lynch in Wednesday night's game. He sat out the rest of the night as a precaution, but expects to be in the lineup tonight when the Pistons face off against the Nets. Chris Herren , G BOS - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 Herren, who is due to come off the injury list this weekend, will start at point guard against Philadelphia on Saturday. He has been sidelined with an ankle injury, which has caused him to miss Boston's first four games. Dikembe Mutombo , C ATL - Fear Updated 11/08/00 The Hawks activated Mutombo from the injured list today, and he will play his first game of the season tomorrow night in Phoenix. He is now cured from a mild case of malaria and should help boost an Atlanta team that started 0-5. Dana Barros , G DET - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 Barros, who has missed all four of Detroit's games this season because of a back injury, is reprortedly making good progress and could be back sooner than expected. He has started running and is participating in shooting drills and scrimmages. Lucious Harris , G NJ - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 Harris is scheduled to dress for tonight's game in Washington, but is unlikley to see any action. He is not expected to be available to the team until Saturday. Bob Sura , G GS - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 Sura, sidelined with a strained lower back, is expected to return to the active roster after the Warriors conclude a four-game road trip on November 19. He did some light running with his team during practice Monday and hopes to begin practicing next week. Ricky Davis , G MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 Davis dribbled and shot on the side on Tuesday, but insists he won't be able to return to the team until December. Head Coach Pat Riley said a decision could be made today as to whether or not Davis will need surgery to repair his injured foot. Latrell Sprewell , G NY - The Wave Updated 11/08/00 Sprewell is reportedly suffering from back spasm which may keep him out of tonight's game against the Cavaliers. Sprewell is currently tied for second on the team in scoring, averaging 13.0 points per game. Cedric Ceballos , F DET - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 11/08/00 Ceballos was benched in Saturday's loss to the Bucks, and Head Coach George Irvine wouldn't say whether he would be back in the lineup tonight against the Sixers. Irvine is reportedly fed up with Ceballos' lack of conditioning and defensive intensity. Randy Brown , G BOS - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 Brown will start at the point for Boston until Kenny Anderson returns from a fractured jaw. In his first start, Brown finished with four assists, two rebounds and no points in a 30-point loss to the Raptors. Tom Hammonds , F MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 Hammonds is now eligible to be removed from the injury list. Head coach Flip Saunders hasn't made a decision yet but said that among the players on the list Hammonds, who is suffering from sore ankles, is the only one healthy enough to play. Tracy Murray , F DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 Murray, last season's eighth-best three-point shooter has played sparingly for the Nuggets so far. He played eight minutes in Monday's game against Dallas and got limited action in the season opener against Seattle. Greg Buckner , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 Buckner's injured right foot is getting better but it is still not known yet when he will be able to return. He said he won't be out for no longer than a week but head coach Don Nelson stated that it could be two weeks. Buckner is suffering from a sprained ligament in his right foot. Hubert Davis and rookie Courtney Alexander have gotten extended playing time in his absence. William Avery , G MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/08/00 With Chauncey Billups in town, Avery has gotten very little playing time for the Timberwolves so far this season. He has appeared in two of the T'Wolves four games this season playing only two minutes. Billups is starting at shooting guard and is being used the backup point guard as well.

Oh thats right Greg. Because was explicitly clear that the pro-Bush folks went out and did the permit dance. So where in the article is this again? Lets get something straight here. This -is- a First Amendment issue. Public streets, provided one isn't blocking traffic, generally tend to be sorta ok, at least from my last interpretation of Con Law a few years ago (I'll feign ignorance wrt the fact that laws may have changed, and the specific facts in this case are weak). IF this guy _was_ merely holding a sign (which it seems was the case for all the pro-bush folks) he did nothing wrong. He certainly didn't do enough of a wrong to warrant a disorderly conduct charge. I'll play with your perspective though. Lets assume a few things. If I walk into the city office and tell them I want to peacably assemble against Bush, do you think they'll give me a permit? Probably not. So I lie. Then the cop does what happened in this scenario. HE walks up, checks my permit and finds out that I falsified my statement to get this said document. He arrests me.

Shouting down has grown to become the answer because the government, over a span of years, and with the help of the Courts -has- limited the rights we have as citizens under the First Amendment. If you question the policy about terrorism, or drugs, or Iraq, or Bush in general, you're aiding terrorism. If you challenge the beliefs of the folks attending the various shadowy G8 conferences, you're an anarchist, and you're herded off to a 'designated protest spot' miles away from anything. Part of the point of speech is to be -heard-. I can scream on my soapbox in the forest somewhere, and while thats speech, its not effective speech. People are screaming and shouting over the political figures because they cannot be heard in any other way.

Getting back to my original point. How do you communicate an idea to an unknown audience, if you're miles from where the audience is? How do you bypass the rules for being -miles- away from the audience without violating the rules of the regime? I don't think Mr. Nell was throwing pies at Bush. A sign, the last time I checked, didn't cause physical injury, or even emotional harm. If I remember Cohen v.

NEW YORK, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Northwest Natural Gas Co is in the final stages to make an offer of $1.8 billion to buy Portland General Electric Co from Enron Corp in a deal that would bring the two Oregon-based utilities together, sources familiar with the situation said. They told Reuters that Northwest was offering a mixture of cash and stock and would also take on an additional $1.0 billion of debt, stamping an enterprise value of $2.8 billion on the assets. The board of Northwest was still to vote on the deal but sources said the deal could be announced as early on Monday. Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Energy Security Concerns On Congressional Front Burner By Bryan Lee 10/05/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Congressional passage of energy policy legislation is unlikely to happen this year as energy infrastructure security has jumped to the forefront as a priority concern after Sept. 11, according to key House and Senate lawmakers. ""I'm not sure there'll be a bill this year,"" said Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. It will be too difficult to reach agreement on the issues involved in passing a comprehensive energy policy bill and still get the measure through conference committee and to the president's desk before Congress adjourns this fall, Bingaman told an industry-sponsored forum this week. Bingaman has slated a hearing on energy infrastructure security for Tuesday, and plans to move legislation on the subject separately from the energy-policy bill. In advance of next week's hearing, Bingaman has solicited comments from leading energy industry groups. ""The priorities have changed since Sept. 11,"" said Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, chairman of the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee. ""The energy security issue is now paramount,"" he said. Barton announced this week that he wouldn't launch a campaign next year for the Senate seat being vacated by Phil Gramm, R-Texas. The decision stemmed in part from a desire to stay at the House Energy and Commerce Committee panel he chairs to work on energy infrastructure concerns. Congress will pass energy-policy legislation next year and focus on energy infrastructure security this year, Barton said, citing the threat to power plants, transmission lines, and natural gas and oil pipelines. The two legislators spoke at an energy forum this week sponsored by Enron Corp. (ENE), entitled ""Energy Policy at a Crossroads."" The priority on infrastructure security was applauded by John M. Derrick, Jr., chairman and chief executive of Potomac Electric Power Co. (POM). ""We in the industry are concerned about an energy hit on our infrastructure,"" Derrick told the two lawmakers. That concern is well-founded, according to James R. Schlesinger, who in past administrations headed the departments of energy and defense, and the Central Intelligence Agency. ""Our electric power grid is particularly vulnerable,"" Schlesinger said, particularly citing the threat from ""information warfare."" Schlesinger's warning was borne out the week after Sept. 11. The North American Electric Reliability Council, the industry group that coordinates power-grid reliability, reported last month its telephones and other communications were temporarily knocked out during a flurry of computer virus attacks. With the onset of increasing wholesale power market competition, the U.S. power grid is operating at a much higher capacity than ever before, making it vulnerable to physical or electronic attack, said Schlesinger. This risk has been compounded since competition has ""weakened the incentive"" for utilities to make needed investment in transmission infrastructure, Schlesinger said. House Panel Acts On Nuclear Security While Bingaman's committee prepares to tackle the issue beginning next week, the House Energy and Commerce Committee took a first stab at the issue this week. On Wednesday, as part of a package of three antiterrorism bills, the panel adopted legislation making sabotage at a nuclear power facility a federal crime and authorizing plant security guards to carry weapons and make arrests. The committee adopted an amendment sponsored by Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., requiring the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to undertake a comprehensive rulemaking to revise its power-plant security regime. ""As terrible as the attacks of Sept. 11 were, a successful terrorist assault on a nuclear power plant could result in a full-scale nuclear core meltdown and breach of containment that could result in countless more deaths and injuries,"" said Markey, who opposes nuclear power. The NRC previously announced it is undertaking a top-to-bottom review of its security requirements in light of the Sept. 11 attacks. ""As decisions are made, they will be implemented,"" said NRC spokesman William Beecher, who otherwise declined to comment on the House action, which is under review by the agency. The Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry's trade group, criticized the House action as a rash response to the Sept. 11 attacks. Nuclear power plant security issues should be addressed as part of an overall effort to secure U.S. energy infrastructure, NEI said. ""We believe the security issue has to be addressed in a comprehensive and thoughtful way. That wasn't done Wednesday,"" said John Kane, NEI's vice president for governmental affairs. Kane also called for Congress to firmly delineate the responsibilities of the federal government and industry in securing nuclear power plants against attack. It isn't appropriate for private industry to respond to threats from enemies of state, he said. Bingaman, the Senate chairman, said Wednesday that, while he supports federalizing airport security, he believes that nuclear power plant defenses should remain the responsibility of the industry. -By Bryan Lee, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-6647; Bryan.Lee@dowjones.com Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Industry lobbying groups Edison Electric Institute and Electric Power Supply Association filed court briefs supporting Enron's position ... (corrects Edison's position). A corrected repetition follows. By Chris Baltimore WASHINGTON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - With billions of dollars at stake in the electricity market, lawyers for Enron Corp urged the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday to uphold federal regulators' obligation to drive open competition on the nation's transmission grid. The nation's highest court heard oral arguments in the case which could have sweeping implications for the $220 billion U.S. electricity market. The Supreme Court's ruling could either open the U.S. transmission grid to retail competition, or limit open markets to just the wholesale realm. A decision is expected later this year or early in 2002. ""It's billions and billions of dollars at stake"" for energy firms, said an industry source. ""A ruling could expand existing open wholesale markets to the retail level."" The case is on appeal from the U.S. Appeals Court for the District of Columbia, which upheld FERC's authority to regulate state transmission in a June 2000 ruling. NEW YORK SAYS FERC WENT TOO FAR Enron - the largest U.S. wholesale power player and an ardent proponent of open markets and nationwide deregulation - argued the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should have authority to force competition of all transmission assets. FERC should expand its authority beyond wholesale markets and states that have deregulated retail markets, Enron says. ""You need a set of rules of the road that apply to everybody,"" said Enron attorney Louis Cohen. Industry lobbying group Electric Power Supply Association filed court briefs supporting Enron's position, while Edison Electric Institute filed in support of FERC. Meanwhile, in a separate companion case, the state of New York argued FERC went too far in regulating flows of electricity within the state. ""This is an example of an agency that has overstepped its bounds,"" said Lawrence Malone, general counsel for the New York State Public Service Commission. New York wants the court to revoke FERC's authority to regulate retail sales, because electricity involved in such sales stays within state boundaries and is not subject to federal regulation. ""We now have two hands on the retail wheel and it doesn't work,"" Malone told the court. Stuck squarely in the middle is FERC, which derives its mandate from an interpretation of the Federal Power Act of 1935. FERC ORDERED OPEN ACCESS At issue is Order 888, which FERC approved in 1996 after it found that transmission-owning utilities have an inherent incentive to bar access to their wires by competing companies. The order essentially opened the grid to wholesale competition by forcing utilities to offer nondiscriminatory policies to energy firms that want to ship electricity over non-owned transmission lines. New York argues that FERC's 1996 order oversteps state authority over intrastate commerce set in the 1935 law, while Enron asserts FERC did not go far enough and needs to expand its authority to both retail and wholesale markets. Because of the interwoven nature of the transmission grid, electricity that flows within state boundaries cannot be distinguished from power that flows from state to state as a result of wholesale sales, Enron's Cohen argued. All of the electricity is competing for space on the grid, and Enron wants FERC to step in to prevent state utilities from ""being able to hog those sites for their own use and keep us off the road,"" Cohen told the court. The Supreme Court justices' leanings on the case were unclear from oral arguments, where they questioned lawyers on interpreting the 1935 act. At least one justice found the intricacies of electricity transmission mechanics daunting. ""It's not like putting water through a dam,"" said Justice Stephen Breyer. ""I don't even know how this works."" Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. BRAZIL: Brazil readies guarantees for electricity sales. By Denise Luna 10/05/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001. RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Brazil is preparing a set of rules to guarantee electricity sales from new thermoelectric plants at market prices in order to get these plants working as soon as possible amid a power crisis. The head of the government's task force for the electricity crisis, Pedro Parente, told reporters on Friday the rules would be published next week and would include government funds to back sale guarantees for the so-called merchant plants. The government of Latin America's largest country regulates electricity prices. Analysts say this system stymies investment in the energy sector, especially in the much-needed natural gas-fired plants, as returns cannot be guaranteed. Most of Brazil's natural gas is imported, and its price in local currency terms grows higher when the real depreciates against the dollar. So far this year, the real has lost about 30 percent of its value. ""We can't have these plants standing idle while the country needs energy,"" Parente said, citing the example of a plant finished by U.S. energy giant Enron Corp. last month, which is not operating due to a lack of contracts at market prices. Brazil needs gas-fired plants as it struggles to reduce its dependence on hydroelectric stations. Two years of droughts have dried up water reservoirs at these plants triggering this year's acute power shortage, which forced the government to impose tough power rationing from June. There is a virtual Wholesale Electricity Market (MAE) in Brazil, but it only quotes prices for electricity and has never seen a single contract struck due to high prices there and existing contracts between generators and distributors. Now, the government's Brazilian Emergency Energy Sales (CBEE) entity, should provide contracts for the new plants at attractive prices taken from MAE. The government expects 10 power plants with a total capacity of 2,153 megawatts to become operational by March 2002, which should boost the total generation capacity of some 70,000 megawatts. Apart from Enron's, a plant built by U.S.-based El Paso Corp. is also ready to start producing energy. The head of Brazil's National Development Bank (BNDES), Francisco Gros, pointed out the financial guarantee would have a limit, which is yet to be established. Gros also acknowledged that the electricity tariffs would have to be reviewed to take into account losses by power utilities since the start of rationing as well as prices to be charged by new power stations. ""We are thinking of a differential hike which can occur gradually, so that it doesn't hit the pocket so much,"" he said, explaining that the losses from lower power consumption totaled 20 percent of revenues on average. Gros also said the bank had enough resources to finance investment projects in the electricity sector and boost the offer of power. Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Brazil To Guarantee Contracts In Wholesale Power Market 10/05/2001 Dow Jones International News (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) RIO DE JANEIRO -(Dow Jones)- The Brazilian government will intervene in the virtually nonexistent wholesale energy market, known as MAE, by paying new merchant power generators in advance for their contracts, top officials said Friday. The decision is valid for independent power generators such as Enron Corp's (ENE) Eletrobolt facility and El Paso Corp.'s (EPG) Macae Merchant unit, which couldn't sell the energy they started producing due to regulatory problems on the MAE. According to the government's emergency plan to generate more power, these plants were supposed to sell their electricity on the free market according to their concession licenses. ""The MAE isn't working and these power plants can't sell the electricity which is already available,"" said Francsico Gros, president of Brazil's Development Bank BNDES, who is heading a commission to come up with a new model for the nation's troubled power sector. ""This is a serious problem which is hurting energy supply when we need all the electricity we can get."" Gros said more than 2,000 megawatts of new electricity are ""waiting to be sold"" but hasn't reached distributors because there hasn't been any trading on the MAE. A recently-created state-run company, called CBEE, will be responsible for settling the contracts for this energy. A percentage of the value of the contract will be paid up front by Brazil's Treasury to guarantee to generators that the contracts will be honored. The government will also establish a ceiling price for contracts. Currently, the price set for power trading at the MAE was 364.00 reals ($1=BRR2.737) per megawatt/hour. In late August, the Brazilian government had already announced it would start buying electricity from independent generators to sell to distributors as an emergency measure aimed at easing the effects of a power crunch and guaranteeing some power supply over the short term. The emergency measures come after the apparent failure of MAE, which kicked off about a year ago with the promise to create a new framework for transactions between power generators and distributors. But regulatory problems robbed MAE of credibility, and the innovative electronic exchange system that was especially designed for the power exchange and was supposed to regulate energy trading, wasn't used at all. Gros said the government is working to restore confidence in MAE by creating more transparent rules for trading on the free energy market. ""MAE is an essential part of our plan for Brazil's energy sector model,"" he said. South America's biggest economy is facing an unprecedented energy crisis after inadequate investment in the past few years and a drought this year that left water reservoirs at record-low levels. Brazil is more than 90% dependent on hydroelectric plants for the electric energy it consumes. An energy-rationing plan was implemented in June to cut electricity use by an average 20% per month. -By Adriana Brasileiro, Dow Jones Newswires; (5521) 9965-1193, adriana.brasileiro@dowjones.com Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. USA: UPDATE 1-Northwest Natural in talks to buy Portland GE. 10/05/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001. NEW YORK, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Northwest Natural Gas Co. on Friday said it was discussing the acquisition of Portland General Electric Co. from Enron Corp., a deal that would bring together two Oregon utilities. The Wall Street Journal said a purchase price of $1.8 billion in cash and stock was being discussed and that Enron would end up with a stake in Northwest. Northwest would also assume $1 billion of debt, it said. The deal would combine the gas and electric utilities serving Portland, Oregon. Northwest shares were down $2.99, or 11.5 percent, at $23 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange, giving up gains totaling $2.89 over the three previous sessions. Enron shares were up 25 cents at $33.35. In a brief statement, Northwest said it was confirming the talks with Enron in response to press reports. It said there was no assurance that a deal would be struck and it would not make any additional comments on the matter unless and until a formal agreement was reached. The Wall Street Journal described the talks as advanced. Citing people familiar with the matter, it said the discussions were at a delicate stage and financing could be a problem for Northwest, which had a market value of only $655.5 million based on Thursday's closing stock price of $25.99. News of the talks did not surprise UBS Warburg analyst James Yannello, who said Enron has made no secret of its desire to divest Portland GE, which serves more than 725,000 customers in northwest Oregon. Enron, an energy marketing and trading powerhouse, acquired Portland GE in July 1997 for stock valued at $2.1 billion. Northwest, doing business as NW Natural, is a gas distribution utility serving more than 500,000 customers throughout Oregon and Vancouver, Washington. On Friday the company raised its quarterly dividend for the 46th year in a row. ENRON SEEN RECEPTIVE TO STOCK On the possibility that Northwest might have trouble financing a deal, Yannello said that in the past Enron has been receptive to accepting stock. He believes Enron ""is taking a very close look at all of its assets,"" and he sees several similar announcements over the next few months. Portland GE, a power generator and distributor, had 2000 revenues of $2.25 billion. Its 2001 first-half revenues rose to $1.6 billion from $827 million a year earlier, and net income increased to $71 million from $63 million. Portland GE pays Enron dividends totaling $20 million each quarter. Portland GE was founded in 1889, delivering power to the city of Portland from the Willamette Falls, 14 miles away on the Willamette River - the first long-distance transmission of electricity in the United States. The company owns eight hydroelectric plants with a total capacity of 615 megawatts. It also has a 65 percent interest in a coal-fired power plant in Boardman, Ore., and a 20 percent stake in a Colstrip, Montana, power plant. These interests, along with 742 megawatts of gas-fired power plants in Clatskanie and Boardman, Oregon, give Portland GE total generation capacity of 1,399.9 megawatts.

Enron in Talks to Sell Portland General to Northwest (Update6) 2001-10-05 16:09 (New York) Enron in Talks to Sell Portland General to Northwest (Update6) (Adds closing share prices in ninth and 13th paragraphs.) Houston, Oct. 5 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. may sell Portland General Electric Co. to Northwest Natural Gas Co., another Oregon utility, as part of a plan to shed slow-growing businesses and focus on commodities trading. Northwest said the companies are in talks, though an agreement isn't assured. The negotiations come more than five months after the sale of Portland General to Sierra Pacific Resources collapsed. Enron spokesman Mark Palmer wouldn't comment. Enron has been trying to sell Portland General for about two years. Houston-based Enron, once mainly an operator of natural-gas pipelines, has transformed itself into the biggest trader of electricity and gas, a business that doesn't require ownership of expensive assets such as power plants and pipelines. Portland General ``is regulated, and it's really slow growth, so it doesn't fit in with what Enron's trying to be,'' said Tara Gately, an analyst with Loomis Sayles & Co., which holds about 135,000 Enron shares. The Wall Street Journal today reported that the two companies are negotiating a sale price of $2.8 billion in cash, stock and assumed debt. Enron bought Portland General in 1997 for $3.1 billion in stock and debt. The utility's earnings are forecast to rise 1 percent next year, said analyst Robert Christensen of First Albany Corp. By comparison, Enron's profit from buying and selling commodities such as energy, lumber and steel is increasing 25 percent a year as more markets open to competition, said Christensen, who rates the shares ``strong buy'' and owns them. ``It would just be a positive to get (the Portland General sale) done and use the cash for other businesses,'' Gately said. Enron shares fell $1.37, or 4.1 percent, to $31.73. Enron stock has declined 62 percent this year, mostly because of the resignation of Chief Executive Jeff Skilling, concerns about the California power market, losses at its bandwidth-trading business and an electricity-contract dispute in India. The stock dropped even as Enron said second-quarter earnings rose 40 percent to $404 million while revenue almost tripled to $50.1 billion. Sierra Pacific canceled its proposed $3.1 billion acquisition of Portland General on April 26 because California's energy crisis made it too hard to win approval. Legislators banned sales of power plants serving the state, blocking Sierra Pacific from selling a stake in a generating plant, needed to win clearance for the deal. ``It's a difficult regulatory environment,'' said Bern Fleming, manager of the $2.4 billion AXP Utilities Income Fund, which holds about 300,000 Enron shares. ``I wonder if someone in that region might handle it better.'' Northwest Northwest shares fell $2.58, or 9.9 percent, to $23.41, cutting its market value to about $588 million. The company, based in Portland, Oregon, would take on about $1 billion in debt with the purchase, the Journal said. Bond rating company Egan Jones lowered its credit rating on Northwest to ``A-'' from ``A,'' still investment grade. Northwest already has about $450 million in debt, Egan Jones said. Other terms of the transaction need to be completed, and an agreement may be announced in a few days, the Journal reported. Northwest serves more than half a million Oregon and Washington customers. Richard Reiten, Northwest's chairman and chief executive, was president of Portland General from 1989 to 1996. At a price of $2.8 billion, Northwest would be paying 1.2 times sales, less than the average of four times revenue paid for U.S. utilities this year, Bloomberg data show. ``It sounds like the transaction would result in Enron retaining a minority stake,'' said Andre Meade, an analyst at Commerzbank Securities Inc. who rates Enron ``accumulate'' and doesn't own the stock. ``It may be that Northwest can only finance a portion of the buy at this stage.'' Oregon regulators likely will approve the transaction if Northwest shows that its service and rates will stay the same, Meade said. The acquisition would allow Northwest to negotiate better gas prices by increasing the amount of the fuel that it buys, he said. The company may also be able to cut costs through job cuts and eliminating duplicate services. Northwest said in July that second-quarter profit more than doubled to $4.3 million as weather cooled and the company added customers. California Platform Enron acquired Portland General, which has more than 700,000 customers in Oregon, as a platform to sell power into California's deregulating market. Since then, Enron has moved away from owning assets such as power plants and pipelines to concentrate on energy trading. As part of that shift, Enron this week agreed to sell oil and gas fields in India to the U.K.'s BG Group Plc for $388 million. Portland General gave Enron experience with the electricity market and utility regulations, and helped the company develop its power-trading business, Loomis Sayles's Gately said. Sierra Pacific, based in Reno, Nevada, agreed to buy Portland General in November 1999. To win regulators' approval of the acquisition, Edison International's utility had to agree to sell a stake in a Nevada power plant also owned by Sierra. California banned power-plant sales by the state's utilities because of its power shortage, blocking the Nevada sale. Enron said at the time that it wouldn't rule out trying again to sell the utility. ScottishPower Plc, the U.K.-based owner of the northwestern U.S. utility PacifiCorp, considered a bid for the utility, the Observer newspaper reported in April.",ham

"Jim, I would appreciate your help in locating financing for the project I described to you last week. The project is a 134 unit apartment complex in San Marcos. There will be a builder/developer plus myself and possibly a couple of other investors involved. As I mentioned last week, I would like to find interim financing (land, construction, semi-perm) that does not require the investors to personally guarantee. If there is a creative way to structure the deal, I would like to hear your suggestions. One idea that has been mentioned is to obtain a ""forward commitment"" in order to reduce the equity required. I would also appreciate hearing from you how deals of this nature are normally financed. Specifically, the transition from interim to permanent financing. I could use a quick lesson in what numbers will be important to banks. I am faxing you a project summary. And I will have the builder/developer email or fax his financial statement to you.

"Market Participants: This notice is to inform you that the ISO is canceling the CMR stakeholder meetings that were scheduled for August 4 and August 8. We are doing so in order to be responsive to Stakeholders' needs for greater detail as articulated in the two most recent Stakeholder meetings on July 19 and 25. As you know, after the July 13-14 introduction to the CME Recommendation, we scheduled additional meetings (July 19th and 25th, August 4th and 8th) to discuss each element of the Recommendation in greater detail. We have received many questions and requests for change on all parts of the Recommendation during the past few weeks. As a result, we determined that we needed more time for internal discussion in order to give you the level of detail that would allow a more meaningful discussion of the specific recommendations and potential modifications. This will allow us to address both your questions and your suggested changes. We have rescheduled these detailed discussions for three consecutive days, August 15-17. In these meetings, we will address: * FTRs; * Day Ahead and Hour Ahead Congestion Management; * Recallable Transmission; * Real Time Operations; * New Generator Interconnection Policy; * Long Term Grid Planning; and * Questions and issues on Local Reliability Service that arose from the July 25 Stakeholder meeting. We will also meet on August 25 to discuss the ISO's final recommendation to the ISO Governing Board. We apologize for any inconvenience this change has caused you, but believe that taking time to develop more details on these topics will allow more productive discussions.

Unbundling: PG&E has a Gas Accord in effect through 12/31/03, which is generally positive. We will participate in the development of a successor plan, and attempt to improve it if we can. SoCalGas attempted its own version of a gas accord, but the CPUC refused to approve. We will attempt to resurrect this accord and obtain CPUC approval. Hedging: No proceeding currently exists to address gas hedging by LDCs. (draft legislation does exist on the electric side to allow hedging and passthrough of costs). Jeff has recommended that we approach the LDCs to begin discussing the issue and developing a strategy to take to the CPUC. I suggest we develop an ENA-EES hedging proposal for CA and then take that to the LDCs. I will attempt to put this is writing. Infrastructure: CPUC has undertaken a proceeding to determine the need to improve infrastructure. SoCal Gas and PG&E are responding with proposals. We want to revitalize the infrastructure and ensure real markets exist and can develop. Our task is to participate in these proceedings. (Please let me know who I left off the mailing list).",ham

"Don't know if you saw this already. Interesting. Ken Indigestion Daniel Fisher, Forbes Magazine, 10.29.01 All those new natural gas-fired electric plants mean more gas demand, right? Maybe not. For natural gas bulls, there was never a surer sign of good times to come than the order book at General Electric Corp. Backlogs in GE's Power Systems group almost tripled to $25 billion in the late 1990s as scores of utilities and freestanding power producers ordered natural gas turbines to supply the nation's growing appetite for electricity. Gas demand had to go up as all those shiny new turbines were connected to the grid. Ah, but there was a flaw in that argument--one that is becoming glaringly clear as the price of gas plunges below $2 per million Btu at the wellhead from as high as $10 last year. (A million Btu of gas equals just about 1,000 cubic feet.) Those new gas plants were supposed to steal business from pollution-spewing coal units, which still supply half the nation's electricity. But in a painstaking study of 788 power plants that supply the bulk of U.S. electricity, Charles Studness, president of Studness Research, found quite the opposite could happen. Studness determined that 79% of the ""new"" electricity supplied to the grid over the past five years came from existing plants, mostly coal-fired units. And there's plenty more where that came from. Studness figures existing coal plants have the potential to increase output by 50 million megawatt-hours a year for the next five years, representing about half the expected 2.5%-a-year increase in demand. Coal's advantage over gas: It's cheap. Utilities paid an average of $1.20 per million Btu for coal last year, compared with $4.30 for gas (delivered). Even with depressed gas prices, many coal plants are still cheaper to operate. So while those new turbines being installed by Calpine (nyse: CPN - news - people) and other independent power producers, (see table, below) will burn a lot of gas, they will do it mostly at the expense of older gas plants that burn half again as much. Addressing a Burning Issue If natural gas prices stay down or merely remain volatile it will help companies that burn, trade or store gas and hurt those that sell it or provide equipment to the industry. Overleveraged gas producers and service companies could have trouble making it through the downturn. WINNERS Sales* ($bil) Remarks Calpine $4.6 Its gas power plants won't compete with coal for years Chesapeake Energy 0.9 Hedged gas production through December 2003 Dynegy 43.4 Owns gas, coal power plants; stores, trades gas Peabody Energy 2.7 World's largest coal company LOSERS Sales* ($bil) Remarks Devon Energy 3.3 Gas-heavy; $8 billion in ...debt General Electric 129.5 Sells gas turbines Pioneer Natural Resources 1.0 $1.5 billion in ...debt; 53% of production is gas Transocean SedcoForex 1.9 $4 billion in debt; heavy gas-drilling exposure *Latest 12 months. Source: Market Guide via FactSet Research Systems. ""It's not our game to compete with coal or nuclear,"" says Ron A. Walter, senior vice president of San Jose, Calif.-based Calpine, which plans over the next few years to build gas-fired plants totaling 31,500 megawatts. ""It's our game to displace older gas."" Combined-cycle gas turbines, which use hot exhaust gases from one turbine to generate steam to turn a second one, can transform 6,800 Btu of gas into a kilowatt-hour of electricity, enough to light one lightbulb for ten hours. The oldest gas plants burn as much as 13,000 Btu, and the national average is 10,500. Substitute enough new plants for old, and U.S. gas consumption, currently 62 billion cubic feet a day, could drop by as much as 1 billion cubic feet a day. That scenario sounds unlikely to Stephen Bergstrom, president of Houston-based Dynegy, an energy-trading firm that also owns both coal- and gas-fired power plants. Dynegy's 35-year-old coal plants are ""huge capital hogs,"" Bergstrom says, that cost ten times as much to maintain as modern gas units. Throw in the cost of scrubbers and other required pollution controls, and many smaller coal plants will have to be shut down, Bergstrom says. But coal-plant owners can be ingenious. Witness Midwest Generation, a nonregulated subsidiary of Edison International that bought six coal plants from troubled Commonwealth Edison of Chicago in 1999. By changing operating procedures and burning a higher grade of coal, Midwest boosted output from the 40-year-old plants 12% last year--while reducing emissions. John Long, vice president and chief technical officer of the Midwest Generation unit, thinks he can coax another 15% increase out of those aging boilers over the next five years without running afoul of environmental rules. Long term, the bullish scenario still holds: Gas will displace coal. In the meantime, gas producers have a lot of bonds to retire.",ham

"Tim, Can you authorize access to the west power site for Keith Holtz. He is our Southern California basis trader and is under a two year contract. On another note, is it my imagination or did the SARR website lower its forecast for McNary discharge during May. It seems like the flows have been lowered into the 130 range and there are fewer days near 170. Also the second half of April doesn't seem to have panned out as I expected. The outflows stayed at 100-110 at McNary. Can you email or call with some additional insight? Thank you, Phillip",ham

Woodruff County deputy Dovey Snyder reported the accident shortly after midnight Monday. Thurston Poole, 33, of Des Arc and Billy Ray Wallis, 38, of Little Rock are listed in serious condition at Baptist Medical Center. The accident occurred as the two men were returning to Des Arc after a frog-gigging trip. On an overcast Sunday night, Poole's pick-up truck headlights malfunctioned. The two men concluded that the headlight fuse on the older model truck had burned out. As a replacement fuse was not available, Wallis noticed that the .22 caliber bullet from his pistol fit perfectly into the fuse box next to the steering wheel column. After inserting the bullet, the headlights again began to operate properly and the two men proceeded toward the White River bridge. After traveling about 20 miles and just before crossing the river, the bullet apparently overheated, discharged and struck Poole in the right testicle. The vehicle swerved sharply right exiting the pavement and striking a tree. Poole suffered only minor cuts and abrasions from the accident, but will require surgery to repair the other wound. Wallis sustained a broken clavicle and was treated and released. ""Thank God we weren't on that bridge when Thurston shot his balls off or we might both be dead"" stated Wallis. ""I've been a trooper for ten years in this part of the world, but this is a first for me. I can't believe that those two would admit how this accident happened,"" said Snyder. Upon being notified of the wreck, Lavinia, Poole's wife asked how many frogs the boys had caught and did anyone get them from the truck. Way to go, Lavinia) >> > J.

"Premonition? From: Jennifer Fraser 10/04/2000 03:01 PM To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: British Trader Sentenced to Prison this could be you British Trader Sentenced to Prison By Jill Lawless Associated Press Writer Tuesday, Oct. 3, 2000; 2:07 p.m. EDT LONDON )) A futures trader who bet the wrong way on U.S. unemployment figures, and destroyed a company in 92 minutes, was sentenced Tuesday to more than three years in jail. ""The position got worse and he was just numb,"" a defense attorney said, comparing the debacle to a bad night at a roulette wheel. Stephen Humphries, 25, formerly a trader at Sussex Futures Ltd., sank the company with losses of $1.1 million. ""During that afternoon of Friday, Aug. 6, 1999, during a period of one hour, 32 minutes, the company's hard-earned reputation and value was destroyed at a stroke ... by the fraudulent trading activity of one man, Stephen Humphries,"" said prosecution lawyer Martin Hicks. Humphries pleaded guilty to one count of fraudulent trading. Judge Denis Levy sentenced him to three years and nine months in prison. Southwark Crown Court heard testimony that Humphries ran up the losses by trading futures contracts in government bonds, and repeatedly lied to superiors about his trades. When worried colleagues left to summon the firm's senior broker, Humphries fled the building. After the huge one-day loss, the company's creditor banks balked and a financial regulator was called in. Sussex Futures ) which employed 70 brokers ) ceased trading three months later with losses of $3.4 million. The court was told that Humphries' trading losses began on the morning of Aug. 6, wiping out two-thirds of his $25,000 trading deposit by lunchtime. The situation worsened at 1:30 p.m., when U.S. economic figures were released showing no increase in the unemployment rate. The data made U.S. interest rates more likely to rise and reduced the value of fixed-interest investments such as British government bonds. Nonetheless, Humphries continued to buy, in quantities that exceeded his trading ceiling. Questioned by co-workers about the large trades going through his account, Humphries said he was in the process of selling out. By the time he fled, he held more than 100 times his trading limit in futures. ""In the course of an afternoon ... you ruined not only your own career, but the career of many others and you caused a prosperous company, Sussex Futures Limited, to go into liquidation, causing loss to the company which trusted you and employed you,"" said the judge. Defense lawyer Simon Ward said Humphries had been under intense financial pressure and was ""deeply sorry."" He had lost a previous job when a trading company he worked for went under ) also at the hands of a rogue trader. He had taken out large bank loans, amassed a substantial credit-card debt and had borrowed from his father's life savings. He and his partner, with whom he had two children, had a third baby die, a blow that affected Humphries' judgment, Ward said. ""This is a tragic and very upsetting case,"" said Ward. ""He was 24, under intense financial and personal pressure and, in effect, lost his head at the roulette table."" , Copyright 2000 The Associated Press Back to the top",ham

Latest NBA Player News Elliot Perry , G PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 The Suns have signed veteran guard Elliot Perry. He will be used primarily as Jason Kidd's backup but has limited Fantasy value. Chris Dudley , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 Dudley was activated from the injured list and started in Thursday's game at Milwaukee. With the lack of depth at center, Dudley could be of good use in a larger Fantasy league, but don't use him in a smaller one. Ruben Garces , F PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 Garces was placed on the injured list to make room for C Chris Dudley. Garces is suffering from a bulging disc in his back. He is used primarily as a third center so he doesn't have a lot of Fantasy value. Donyell Marshall , F UTA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 Marshall had missed the two games prior to Thursday's action because of a sprained knee, but returned to the lineup against Vancouver and had seven points and three rebounds in 14 minutes. Because Marshall comes off the bench he doesn't have much Fantasy value. But with him back in the rotation forwards Karl Malone and Bryon Russell will play less minutes now. Carlos Rogers , F HOU - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 Rogers will be sidelined indefinitely after suffering a sprained knee. He is a reserve forward with very little Fantasy value but his absence will force the starting frontcourt to play more minutes. This could have positive or negative affects on their production. If you have Houston frontcourt players on your roster monitor them to see if they flourish or flounder under the current conditions. Donnell Harvey , F DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 Harvey has been activated from the injured list to make room for the injured Greg Buckner. Harvey is a solid rebounder but won't receive enough playing time to be a valuable Fantasy player. Greg Buckner , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 Buckner will undergo surgery early next week to remove a cracked bone spur on his right foot. The surgery could sideline Buckner for 6-8 weeks. Rookie Donnell Harvey was activated form the injured list to make room for Buckner. This is the second time this season that he has been sidelined with the same injury. Fantasy owners should avoid Buckner for he rest of the season or until he is playing and producing on a consistent basis again. Charles Oakley , F TOR - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 Oakley has served his league-imposed suspension and is eligible to return to the Raptors' lineup for Friday night's game at Golden State. ""Oak,"" who was suspended for punching Clippers' point guard Jeff McInnis, has Fantasy value as a rebounder only, and isn't considered a real commodity outside of deeper leagues. Vince Carter , G TOR - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/08/00 Although the team is calling him a game-time decision, it looks as though Carter will return to the court on Friday night against the Golden State Warriors. Carter practiced with the team on Thursday, and is exciting about the prospect of playing against his former Tar Heel teammate, Antawn Jamison. All signs point towards Carter's return by this weekend at the very latest, so add a little ""Vinsanity"" to your starting lineup next week. Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/08/00 Hill was a game time scratch on Thursday night against the Nuggets. The Orlando Sentinel is reporting that Hill is expected to return to the court on Monday when the Magic travel to Los Angeles for a date with the Clippers. Hill's return is long overdue for Fantasy owners who held onto his rights this season. Unless you have a number of solid forwards on your roster, give Hill the start this week pending any setbacks. Hidayet Turkoglu , G SAC - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00 Turkoglu is suffering from a shoulder injury and is questionable for Friday's game against Houston. He is a key reserve on the Kings' team but has very little Fantasy value. Steve Nash , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00 Nash returned to action against the Knicks Wednesday after missing two straight games because of a calf injury. He didn't seem to be bothered by the injury as he scored 14 points and dished off for six assists. It is now safe to play Nash on your Fantasy team again. Donyell Marshall , F UTA - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00 Marshall is recovering from a sprained knee and is questionable for Thursday's game against the Grizzlies. Look for starters Bryon Russell and Karl Malone to play extra minutes in his absence. Avoid using Marshall until he appears to be fully recovered. Kevin Garnett , F MIN - Farragut Academy Updated 12/07/00 Garnett hurt his right ring finger in Tuesday's game and was scheduled to have it examined Wednesday. He is expected to play against the Wizards Thursday. Monitor Garnett's situation. Something as simple as an injured finger on his shooting hand could lead to an offensive slump and affect his Fantasy numbers. Terry Davis , F DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00 Davis will be eligible to come off the injured list Sunday but Achilles tendonitis in his right leg is expected to keep him sidelined a little bit longer. He has been injury prone throughout his career and doesn't have much Fantasy value. Antonio McDyess , F DEN - The Rounders Updated 12/07/00 McDyess suffered a bruised right shin in Wednesday's game against the Heat and is questionable for Thursday's matchup against the Magic. Keon Clark will start at power forward if McDyess is unable to play. The leg is sore now but look for McDyess to be back to normal in a few days. Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/07/00 Hill may be ready to return to the court for Thursday night's game against the Nuggets. He has missed most of the season with an ankle injury, but he practiced on Wednesday, and all indications signal his return to the court. ""I can't give you the official thumbs up,"" said Head Coach Doc Rivers, ""but it looks good."" Fantasy owners who have been waiting for Hill's return will likely get him back in time for next week, when Orlando embarks on a four-game West Coast road trip. Gary Trent , F DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00 According to The Dallas Morning Star Mavericks owner Mark Cuban is hopeful that Trent will travel on the Mavericks' next road trip, a six-game swing on the East Coast. Trent is not expected to be activated on the trip but could be back in action in another two weeks. He has been sidelined since the first preseason game with a strained upper abductor muscle. Trent is a good inside scorer and a solid rebounder but is injury prone. When he does return Fantasy owners should refrain from picking him up unless they desperately need a forward. Stephon Marbury , G NJ - The Old School Fools Updated 12/07/00 Marbury missed his second consecutive game on Wednesday night because of an ankle injury. He turned the ankle last Friday night in Orlando, then turned it again the following night against the Magic back in New Jersey. He is still lacking some of his explosiveness, but says that the pain in the ankle is diminishing. Marbury hopes to return on Friday night when the Nets host the Phoenix Suns. Fantasy owners who lost Marbury last week should have their star point guard back in time for next week's roster changes. Vince Carter , G TOR - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/07/00 Carter was in uniform for Wednesday night's game against Portland, but he didn't see any playing time. ""Air Canada"" said that he felt well enough to play, but team doctors wouldn't give him permission to get in the game. ""We'd like to have him back as soon as possible,"" said Head Coach Lenny Wilkens, ""but we're not going to bring him back before he's ready."" Toronto finishes their three-game West Coast swing on Friday night against Golden State, at which time Carter hopes to make his return. The Raptors' star should be back before Monday, so most Fantasy owners can re-insert him into their lineup in time for next week. Andre Miller , G CLE - The Rounders Updated 12/07/00 Miller took a knee to the nose during Wednesday night's game at Chicago which sent him to the bench temporarily. He returned to the game with a vengeance, finishing with 20 points, 14 assists and seven rebounds in Cleveland's 92-88 victory. The shot to the nose won't keep Miller from missing any playing time, so continue to use the young point guard in your starting lineup. Elton Brand , F CHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/07/00 Brand missed his second consecutive game on Wednesday night against Cleveland. He is reportedly making progress with his hyperextended left knee, and has been able to run on a treadmill this week. Brand is listed as day to day, and says that he has about a 50 percent chance of playing on Friday night against Dallas. With most roster changes occurring on Monday, Fantasy owners should be able to put the Bulls' star back in their lineup for next week's games. Eric Snow , G PHI - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/06/00 The 76ers will be without Snow for six to eight weeks after a CT scan Wednesday showed a stress fracture in his right ankle. He was second on the team with a career-high 12.2 ppg, and led the Sixers with 6.6 assists per contest. Although Philadelphia sports a deep roster, one can't help but assume this will have an impact on the team's fortunes for Fantasy purposes. Chris Dudley , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00 Dudley will travel with the Suns on their end of the week road-trip that starts in Milwaukee Thursday. He will most likely be questionable for all the games. Look for him to finally return to action next week. With Dudley out of the lineup Corie Blount and rookie Daniel Santiago will continue to get playing time. With the lack of depth at center, Dudley's rebounding makes him a starter on your Fantasy team if you are using a reserve in his position. Chris Mills , F GS - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00 Mills is doubtful for Wednesday's game against the Lakers because of pain in his right ankle. He was scheduled to see a foot specialist on Tuesday and underwent surgery last season to remove bone spurs from the ankle. Sit Mills on your Fantasy bench for now. If you are playing in a small league drop him from your roster and add another forward. Ron Mercer , G CHI - The Old School Fools Updated 12/06/00 Mercer sat out of Tuesday's game against the T'Wolves because of the flu. Corey Benjamin started at shooting guard in place of Mercer. Mercer's status for Wednesday's game is up in the air. He has been a major disappointment so far this season. If you play in a deep Fantasy league keep him on your roster, if you are in a smaller one look to make an upgrade at guard. The way Mercer has been producing you shouldn't have a hard time finding a better guard. Jerome Williams , F DET - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00 Williams sprained his ankle in Tuesday's game against the Grizzlies and is questionable for Wednesday's contest at Seattle. The ankle will probably limit Williams' production in the next few games so use a healthy forward instead. Billy Owens , F DET - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00 Owens strained his right biceps in Tuesday's game against Vancouver. He has actually been productive this season when healthy, but don't gamble on him. Owens has been injury prone throughout his career and is too risky a player to take a chance on. Use a more durable player instead. Joe Smith , F DET - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00 Smith got his first start as a Piston Tuesday at power forward. He scored 12 points and grabbed eight rebounds. With his promotion into the starting lineup it is now safe to start Smith on your Fantasy team. With an increased role Smith will be a consistent rebounder and scorer. John Wallace , F DET - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00 Wallace was placed on the injured list due to tendonitis in his left knee. He is a good offensive player but his shortcomings on defense have limited his playing time. His lack of playing time prevents him from being a productive Fantasy player so avoid using him in your league More Updates Copyright 2000 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

"Andy: Enjoyed meeting with you. One more thing I did not address. My ultimate goal is to move all volume to EOL. However, in addition to the NYMEX, we have about 6 other viable electronic trading systems. We make it a point to never support these if possible. We will only trade if the other system's offer is at or greater than our bid. For instance, if we are 6/8 but have a strong inclination to buy and another system is at 7, I will simultaneously lift their 7's and move my market to 7/9. The lesson the counterparty gets is he will only get the trade if I'm bidding 7 and he will only get executed when it is a bad trade to him. People have learned fairly quickly not to leave numbers on the other systems because they will just get picked off. If they don't post numbers on the other systems, the systems get no liquidity and die. I mention this because I have heard that Enron is a fairly large trader on Spectron's system. I don't know whether it is in regards to gas, power, or metals. Just something to think about and maybe talk about with the other traders.

"Is there any chance that the request to gather data on financial trades is implemented? Our understanding was that the commission had no jurisdiction over financial markets. -----Original Message----- From: Fulton, Donna Sent: Tuesday, June 19, 2001 9:19 AM To: Steffes, James; Nicolay, Christi; Novosel, Sarah; Lawner, Leslie; Cantrell, Rebecca; Miller, Stephanie; Allen, Phillip K. Cc: Alvarez, Ray Subject: El Paso Merchant Comments on Reporting Requirements El Paso Merchant filed comments yesterday in the Reporting Requirements docket. They did not argue against the collection of the new proposed data, but rather argued that the Commission needed to add to the information to be gathered to include financial market data. El Paso states that the financial market is believed to be ten times as large as the physical market. El Paso suggests the following information be collected: the name of the counter party to the financial trade the quantitiy of gas underlying the financial trade all the pricing terms of the trade stated in price per MMBtu the time period of the trade, including starting and ending dates the date on which the deal was entered into the type of trade El Paso Merchant also argues for confidential treatment and a sunset date for the collection of the data (tied to when EIA finds supply and demand in California in balance.)

"For purposes of an accelerated distribution from the PSA, a ""single sum distribution,"" in Section 6.2 means that a PSA account is distributed all at once, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement. Section 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant. A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock. Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock. The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election. Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan.",ham

I simply put it (them) into my (nmh) component files (components, replcomps, forwcomps and so on). That way you get them when you are editing your message.

Under its price cap rules, the ISO is allowed to exceed its cap in ""out-of-market"" purchases, which is when it purchases power in deals arranged directly with sellers over the phone, rather than through its usual computer-based purchasing system. The current cap was lowered to $250/MWh from $500/MWh starting August 7. The ISO wouldn't confirm that it had to pay more than $250 Monday. ""We're not going to reveal whether this is happening, or at what price,"" spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkel told Dow Jones Newswires. ""For the sake of protecting consumers, we will keep our price strategy confidiential. But any out-of-market purchase above the cap is very rare."" On Sunday, the ISO agreed to pay about $350/MWh at Palo Verde to a southwest utility for on-peak Monday power, according to a trader for the utility, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Bilateral trades not involving the ISO were done as high as $375/MWh Monday afternoon in the real-time market. Other market sources said that the ISO exceeded its cap again Tuesday afternoon, when several major California generating units were be taken off line for unplanned repairs, and the real-time market rose to $500/MWh for one hour at Palo Verde. Those purchases couldn't be confirmed with sellers. According to its price cap rule, ""Such reduced cap shall not apply to out-of-market calls placed by management to out-of-state generator resources."" Some market participants say that regular out-of-market purchases above $250/MWh could persuade suppliers to not offer power to the ISO via its computer-based system, which has plateaued at $250/MWh for most of both Monday and Tuesday afternoons. And owners of generating stations in California say there is no justification for giving preferential treatment to out-of-state generators. -Mark Golden; Dow Jones Newswires 201-938-4604; mark.golden@dowjones.com Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company Inc G_nther A.

"---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/08/2000 12:28 PM --------------------------- ""George Richards"" <cbpres@austin.rr.com> on 09/08/2000 05:21:49 AM Please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com> To: ""Phillip Allen"" <pallen@enron.com> cc: ""Larry Lewter"" <retwell@mail.sanmarcos.net> Subject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin that we told you about. As you can tell from the proforma this project should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years. This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for this market. This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we have uncovered to date in the Austin market. The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan. As it is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austin for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete in less than 6 months. Additionally, many of the current and more severe water treatment ordinances have been waived. I have estimated the lot improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street widening. Even though this property is not likely to require street widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond requirement, I used this data to be cautious. The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not expected to impact sales significantly. Other projects have been quite successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University. As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods is uneven. We have included a fence around the entire property, but may only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop. Gated communities are far preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer preferences. The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and an extended escrow. This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan. This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the profits of the project. As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity with your profit in the lot. I believe this would facilitate the use of a 1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then be the equity for that project. You would need to discuss this with an exchange expert first. Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San Antonio if you do not know anyone. I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker, by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery. Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to schedule a tour of the site and the area. Please get back to me as soon as your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any time. You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either 512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110. My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is 512-338-1103. I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you on this project that is sure to be a major winner. I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual events these past few weeks. A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes. One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to start the next day. The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough to knock it down. The City shut down the project for a week and it took another week to get every thing back on tract. Then last week I had to take my wife to emergency. She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this past week.. There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize the enormous number of things she does everyday. Fortunately, it looks as if she will be ok in the long run. George W.

Latest NFL Player News Jermaine Lewis , WR BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 With Travis Taylor now out for the season, expect Lewis to line up as the second wideout along with Qadry Ismail. Lewis assumed that spot in last Sunday's game against Cincinnati and caught four passes for 25 yards. He needs to perform well over the season's final weeks to be in the Ravens' receiving picture for 2001. Marcus Pollard , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 Pollard put up decent numbers in Sunday's game at Soldier Field against the Bears. He caught three passes for 42 yards in the Colts' 27-24 loss. E.G. Green , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 In his first game back in seven weeks, Green pulled in five passes for 45 yards in Sunday's loss to the Bears. He may see some increased playing time in the offense, and could even spend some time as the Colts' number two receiver in the offense. Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 In his first productive game in weeks, Pathon caught three passes for 58 yards and a touchdown in Sunday's loss to the Bears. Pathon may see more looks in the offense in the coming weeks, as Head Coach Jim Mora looks to spread the ball around a bit more through the air. Ken Dilger , TE IND - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 11/09/00 Dilger posted his second consecutive good outing for the Colts this weekend, catching five passes for 66 yards in the Colts' 27-24 loss to the Bears at Soldier Field. He now has 36 receptions for 441 yards and three touchdowns on the season. Edgerrin James , RB IND - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/09/00 James complied 117 yards of total offense and scored two touchdowns in last Sunday's 27-24 loss to the Bears. He is now second in the league with 13 touchdowns, one behind the Rams' Marshall Faulk. He could very well surpass Faulk this week against the Jets - he has scored at least one touchdown in each of his last four games. Steve Christie , K BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 Christie kicked his second consecutive game-winning field goal for the Bills this week in New England. He hit on a 48-yarder in the fourth quarter to send the game to overtime, then sealed the win with a 32-yard boot in the extra session. He kicked three field goals in all, and is now 20-of-23 in field goal attempts on the season. Jeremy McDaniel , WR BUF - FDIC Updated 11/09/00 McDaniel caught only one pass for 24 yards in Sunday's game against the Patriots. In spite of the poor performance, McDaniel is still second on the team in both receptions (27) and receiving yards (443). Peerless Price , WR BUF - The Rounders Updated 11/09/00 Price caught three passes for 36 yards in Sunday's win against the Patriots. Although he is on pace to improve on all of his numbers from a year ago, Price has been a bust as far as Fantasy owners are concerned. Jay Riemersma , TE BUF - Mean Machine Updated 11/09/00 The Bills' tight end had a solid Fantasy performance on Sunday, catching six passes for 49 yards and a touchdown. Riemersma has historically had good success when Doug Flutie starts for the Bills, so keeping him in the lineup this week may be a good idea. Antowain Smith , RB BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 Smith saw his first action in the last six weeks, but got only three carries for 13 yards in Sunday's game at Foxboro. He won't get much playing time for the rest of the year, and will likely look to leave Buffalo at the end of the season. Shawn Bryson , RB BUF - Meximullets Updated 11/09/00 Bryson got the majority of the carries in Sunday's game against New England. He ran the ball 13 times for 60 yards in Buffalo's 16-13 overtime victory. Corey Bradford , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 Bradford isn't expected to play Sunday against Tampa Bay after injuring the quadriceps muscle near his right knee. The Packers will probably sit Bradford and give him time to rest. He is just getting in shape after missing seven games this season because of a broken leg. Donald Driver will probably take his place as the third receiver. Ahman Green , RB GB - Ramiro Updated 11/09/00 Dorsey Levens had arthropscopic surgery on his injured knee Tuesday so Green will likely be the starting back for the rest of the season. He has played well in 2000 gaining 474 yards and scoring four touchdowns. Green still has a penchant for fumbling, and has done so three times this season, but he managed to hold on to the ball in a rainy game vs. Minnesota Monday. Titans , DT TEN - Fear Updated 11/09/00 It's highly likely that Tennessee's defense is on a roster in every Fantasy league, but you might want to look into acquiring it in a trade for the remainder of the season. The Titans' D has four games against some of the league's youngest quarterbacks over its final seven games - Spergon Wynn of Cleveland twice, and Akili Smith of Cincinnati and Donovan McNabb of Philadelphia once. Desmond Howard , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 Howard is expected to play in Sunday's game against Atlanta. He sat out last week's matchup against the Dolphins due to a neck injury. Derrick Mason , WR TEN - The Snake Pit Updated 11/09/00 Receiver and kick returner Mason practiced yesterday despite suffering from ankle and back injuries. He is listed as questionable on the Titans' injury report for Sunday's game against Baltimore. Chris Sanders , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 Sanders was able to practice with the Titans yesterday, and didn't appear to be suffering from any effects from a rib cartilage strain that knocked him from last Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. Tennessee will rely on him if Carl Pickens or Yancey Thigpen can't play Sunday against Baltimore. Paul Edinger , K CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 Edinger is finally beginning to settle into the job as the Bears' placekicker. He made 4-of-8 field goals to start the season but has connected on his last seven field-goal attempts, including kicks of 41 and 37 yards last Sunday. Edinger is now 11-of-15 for the season, including 4-of-7 from beyond the 40. Yancey Thigpen , WR TEN - The Rounders Updated 11/09/00 Thigpen got a second opinion Tuesday about his injured left ankle, which confirmed that he has a condition that will hamper him for the rest of the season. He received an injection and was able to practice comfortably yesterday, and looks to be on the mend. We'll keep tabs on Thigpen's status for Sunday's game against Baltimore. Marcus Robinson , WR CHI - Meximullets Updated 11/09/00 Robinson is on the verge of surpassing 1,000 receiving yards for the second consecutive season. Robinson has made seven of the Bears' eight longest plays from scrimmage this season, including all five of his touchdown receptions. He has catches of 68, 58, 55 and 48 yards from Cade McNown and a 34-yard TD pass from Jim Miller. Carl Pickens , WR TEN - The Fat Bastards Updated 11/09/00 Pickens missed yesterday's practice with his hamstring injury, and the Titans are taking a wait-and-see attitude towards his status. He is still sore and appears unlikely to post good numbers even if he does play. Eddie George , RB TEN - Fear Updated 11/09/00 Although George was unable to practice yesterday due to a toe injury, Coach Jeff Fisher says he would have participated some had the session been conducted on grass instead of artificial turf. George is expected to play Sunday against Baltimore, although keep in mind that the Ravens have the NFL's top-ranked rush defense. Scott Dragos , RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 Dragos is still suffering from an injured quadriceps and is questionable for Sunday's game at Buffalo. He played a major role as a blocker for James Allen when Curtis Enis was inactive. With Enis back the Bears don't need Dragos as much for blocking but may use him as their long snapper. Regular long snapper Pat Mannelly has an injured elbow and is questionable for Sunday's game as well. Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - Murder Inc. Updated 11/09/00 Smith was limited in practice because of his hamstring and knee injuries, but he will return to action Sunday against Seattle. Smith missed Jacksonville's last game October 29 against Dallas, but was able to rest over the bye week last week. Cade McNown , QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 McNown is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game at Buffalo. Head coach Dick Jauron said that McNown may be used as the emergency QB if his seperated left shoulder continues to improve this week. Jaguars , DT JAC - The Snake Pit Updated 11/09/00 The Jaguars will be without linebacker Hardy Nickerson, who underwent arthroscopic knee surgery last Friday, for Sunday's game against Seattle. Linebackers Lonnie Marts and Brant Boyer, both suffering from groin injuries, are listed as questionable on the injury report. Eric Storz and Kevin Hardy would be the likely replacements if neither can play. Defensive end Renaldo Wynn practiced yesterday and may return to action Sunday after missing four games with a torn MCL in his right knee. Defensive tackle Gary Walker will play after missing Jacksonville's last game against Dallas October 29. Derek Brown , TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 The Cardinals re-signed Brown on Wednesday after tight end Jay Tant was lost for the season with a torn ACL. Brown had played for the Cardinals since 1992 but was cut before the start of this season. Jay Tant , TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 Tant tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during last Sunday's 16-15 win against the Redskins. He will miss the remainder of the season. David Patten , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/09/00 Patten, who has played sparingly the past three weeks with a turf toe injury, is listed as doubtful on the Browns' injury report. He missed practice yesterday and is unlikely to make any Fantasy impact Sunday against New England. More Updates Transactions?NFL Reports?

"Dear Friend, Thousands more Americans have signed their Petition to Certify the Bush Victory at http://www.electionIntegrity2000.com . We,re building a tidal wave of public support for fairness and integrity in the aftermath of this presidential election. Make no mistake, Al Gore,s team of lawyers and activists are fighting to the finish in a desperate attempt to overturn the results in Florida. Here,s the latest: After hand picking Florida counties to conduct recount after recount and using the Florida Supreme Court to help them rewrite the election rules, it still didn,t look like Al Gore was going to be able to manufacture enough votes to win. But they want this election and they,re not giving up without a fight. Statistically, early returns from the manual recounts (hand- counts) did not show Al Gore overtaking George W. Bush,s lead in Florida. So the Democrats have simply changed the ""hand-counting"" rules again. The new rules say that ballots with dimples, loose chad or any indentation in the area of the box should be counted. No punch hole in the ballot is necessary for Gore to gain a vote! This amounts to mind reading because the activists conducting the recount are allowed to divine the intent of the voter. Gore,s team argues that ""every vote should be counted"" hoping to gain votes in their favor, but they use every technicality to disqualify thousands of military ballots delivered without a post mark. Why? Because these ballots likely favor Bush at a rate of 2 to 1! And even though military servicemen abroad can,t control how their mail is delivered, Gore,s allies are fighting to deny their votes. We the American people must fight this systematic and calculated effort to overturn the election. We must fight in the media. We must fight in the courts. We must fight in the Florida legislature. We must fight for public opinion. One way you can help is by urging your friends and family to join our online campaign to Certify the Bush Victory at http://www.algorelost.org or http://www.electionintegrity2000.com right now.

"i agree with rob. i think if the phones (and mms is building traction in europe in handsets), this might be interesting. bottom line is will it a) help sell phones and b) bill enough time on the wcarriers networks? anyone remember the polariod photo sticker fad? low quality, small in size. but kids totally dug that stuff. seems like every adolescent girl had that stuff at one point. and it never replaced or aimed to replace digital cameras or normal photographs. i don't think mms photos will be a substitute for other photography - developed at the local 1 hour joint or digital photos on your pc. i think it expands the market and forms a new category. the extent of the category size is the big question (will it be a fad or will it a sustained market). that's consumer behavior and marketing. but i don't think the technology adoption will follow a substitution of another product on the market (in this case, digital photos or normal photos). europe's the one to watch - more teenagers have wireless phones and if the pricing and marketing is right, they'll figure out what to do with it once the carriers how to figure out how to market it to them. -h >From: ""Rob Shavell"" <rob@mobiusvc.com> >To: ""'Mike Masnick'"" <mike@techdirt.com> >Cc: <fork@example.com> >Subject: RE: sprint delivers the next big thing?? >Date: Wed, 21 Aug 2002 01:10:50 -0700 > >right Mike, > >i will agree to disagree but i take your comments to heart. my opinion is >only that this is one of the last frontiers of communications ('instant >show') that we cross easily (though you are right as rain on pricing). i am >mildly amused at the level of skepticism and innatention it is getting. > >my premise is that the world will change in dramatic and unexpected ways >once there are a billion 'eye's' which can instantly share what they see >amongst each other. that doesn't mean that people will stop talking on >their phones, or that people will spend more time w/images than voice. just >that it is fundamental. from news to crime to privacy to dating to family >life to bloopers and practical jokes, i believe there will be an explosion >of images unleashed specifically by cell phone integrated lenses because of >their utter ubiquity that dwarfs all pictures taken in the history of >photography by orders of magnitude and in short order. and yes, changes >things 'big time'. > >rgds, >rob > > >-----Original Message----- >From: Mike Masnick [mailto:mike@techdirt.com] >Sent: Tuesday, August 20, 2002 11:58 PM >To: Rob Shavell >Cc: fork@example.com >Subject: RE: sprint delivers the next big thing?? > > >Not to keep harping on this, but... > >At 11:36 PM 8/20/02 -0700, Rob Shavell wrote: > >>content: who cares about content? that no one can think of 'useful' >content >>is always the business persons mistake. the content is the users >>communications. its anything and everything. avg person could easily send >>half dozen pics to a dozen people a day. mainly humorous i'd guess. who >>cares if content is trivial in nature. picture speaks a thousand words. > >This does nothing to answer my question.

"Quantity Limits- For SCE and PG&E, previously approved BFM limitations are the following: SCE Limits for BFM products including retail energy transactions, and daily and balance of the month BFM products: Retail Energy markets are limited at SCE's net short position which is a maximum of Q1: 2,200 MW, Q2 2,200 MW, Q3: 5,200 MW, Q4: 3,000 MW Participation ion daily and balance of the month BFM products are limited to amounts above 1,000 MW SCE's net short position. PG&E Limits for BFM products including retail energy transactions, and daily and balance of the month BFM products: Retail Energy markets are limited at PG&E's net short position which is not disclosed. However it is reasonable to assume that it is at least 3,000 MW for the summer quarters given that PG&E had previously filed asking for a limit of 3,000 MW. Participation in daily and balance of the month BFM products are limited to amounts above 1,000 MW PG&E's net short position. SDG&E BFM limits approved in Advice Letter 1234-E Monthly and Quarterly Forward Market: 1900 MW July-September, 1700 MW all other months Daily and Balance of Month quantities will not exceed 1000 MW more than the limits in the forward markets Ancillary Services will not exceed 90% of SDG&E's forecast ancillary services for the month or the quarter.

Quantities are limited to previously authorized limits in the forward market (the PX Block Forward Markets) The contracts must expire on or before 12/31/05. For both PG&E and SCE, these contracts will be subject to limited reasonableness review. PG&E will not be allowed to enter into such contracts after the transition period ends (3/31/02). The Commission will continue e to oversee the procurement practices on a quarterly basis. This was an emergency motion, so it is reasonable to assume that both PG&E and SCE can enter into such transactions immediately.

Natural gas demand will also grow at about 2.3 percent this year, the EIA said in its monthly supply and demand report. Natural gas is the third most popular fuel used by U.S. electricity generating plants after nuclear and coal. U.S. electricity demand in the first quarter of 2001 was forecast at about 896 billion kilowatt hours (kwh), the EIA said. That is slightly higher than the 895.8 billion kwh forecast by the agency last month. For the entire winter heating season of October through March, electricity demand was forecast to rise by 4.6 percent from the previous year, the EIA said. The increase was driven by the residential and commercial sectors, which were forecst to be higher by 8 and 4 percent, respectively. More electricity plants were expected to switch from natural gas back to fuel oil as oil prices drift lower, the government report said. ""This trend is expected to continue through the first quarter 2001,"" the EIA said. ""Although the favorable price differential for oil relative to gas is expected to continue through the forecast period, by the second half of 2001, expected increases in gas-fired capacity are expected to keep gas demand for power generation growing."" The monthly report also said that mild weather has eased natural gas prices in California, but the state still faces gas supply and deliverability bottlenecks affecting its electricity plants. California has been fighting all winter to maintain",ham

"As you are aware, Enron utilizes temporary staffing services to satisfy staffing requirements throughout the company. For the past several months, a project team, representing Enron,s temporary staffing users, have researched and evaluated alternative Managed Services programs to determine which source would best meet our current and future needs in terms of quality, performance and cost containment objectives. The Business Unit Implementation Project Team members are: Laurie Koenig, Operations Management, EES Carolyn Vigne, Administration, EE&CC Linda Martin, Accounting & Accounts Payable, Corporate Beverly Stephens, Administration, ENA Norma Hasenjager, Human Resources, ET&S Peggy McCurley, Administration, Networks Jane Ellen Weaver, Enron Broadband Services Paulette Obrecht, Legal, Corporate George Weber, GSS In addition, Eric Merten (EBS), Kathy Cook (EE&CC), Carolyn Gilley (ENA), Larry Dallman (Corp/AP), and Diane Eckels (GSS) were active members of the Selection Project Team. As a result of the team,s efforts, we are pleased to announce the beginning of a strategic alliance with CORESTAFF,s Managed Services Group. This group will function as a vendor-neutral management entity overseeing all staffing vendors in the program scope. They will also provide a web based online technology tool that will enhance the ordering and reporting capabilities. The goal of our alliance with CORESTAFF is to make obtaining a temporary worker with the right skills and experience easier while protecting the best interests of the organization. We plan to implement Phase I of this improvement effective January 2, 2001. This Phase I of the implementation will encompass administrative/clerical temporary workers at the Houston locations only. If you currently have administrative/clerical temporary workers in your department, the enhancement will not affect their position. In an effort to preserve relationships, all current staffing vendors will be invited to participate in this enhanced program. CORESTAFF shares our commitment to minimize any disruptions in service during this transition. We expect to incorporate the administrative/clerical workers in Omaha, Seattle and Portland in Phase II, which is scheduled for February, 2001. The scope and timing of any additional phases will be determined after these two phases have been completed. Realizing the impact that the temporary workforce has in business today, we selected CORESTAFF,s Managed Services Group based on their exceptional management team, commitment to quality service, and creative solutions to our staffing needs. The relationship promises to offer Enron a cost effective and simple means for obtaining temporary employees. In the coming weeks, Enron and CORESTAFF,s Managed Services Group will be communicating to Enron,s administrative/clerical temporary staffing vendors about the new process. There are many benefits to this new Managed Services program, which are outlined on the attached page. More details on how to utilize CORESTAFF,s Managed Services program will be announced soon and meetings will be scheduled to demonstrate the reporting system and to meet the Managed Services team. What is Managed Services? CORESTAFF,s Managed Services program includes: ? Vendor-neutral management model ? Equal distribution of staffing orders to all staffing partners ? Web-based application with online ordering, data capture and customized reporting ? Benchmarking and performance measurement for continuous improvement ? Methodologies for accurate skill-matching and fulfillment efficiencies Key Benefits ? More vendors working on each order from the outset ) faster access to available talent pools ? Standardized mark-ups and fees to manage costs more effectively ? Online access to requisition status for users ? Robust databases offering managers enhanced tracking and reporting of temporary usage and expenditures ? Standard and customized reporting capabilities -- online ?

The transport delivery off HPLC was shorted to keep Entex whole on a minimum purchase from ENA. Originally this transport imbalance was to be cleared the next month in May of 1999. Some of the imbalance was cleared in May of 1999, but 91,297 MMBtu still remains as a imbalance on this contract. We need to monitor the IFHSC Index for the upcoming months so that when one is compatible with the IFHSC Index of April of 1999 we can clear this imbalance. We will need to allocated 91,297 MMBtu extra to the transport. This will reduce the purchase from ENA by 91,297 MMBtu for that month. I need you to watch over whoever is doing the Reliant Energy - Entex allocation to make sure this happens. Thanks, Michael",ham

"Thanks for doing this. We really appreciate it. -----Original Message----- From: Bailey, Susan Sent: Friday, January 18, 2002 4:53 PM To: Newbrough, Jennifer Cc: Shackleton, Sara Subject: RE: Forest Products Trading Counterparties Jennifer, I have completed my review of the selected Forest Products counterparties listed in your email request of January 15th. My review focused on the ""Confidentiality"" provision contained in either the Master Agreement or the Confirmation(s), being the documentation which established the trading relationship with either Enron North America Corp. (""ENA"") or Enron Canada Corp. (""ECC""). I was asked to determine if the ""Confidentiality"" provision in our trading documents would prohibit ENA and/or ECC from disclosing to third parties: (a) ""the existence of a Master Agreement"" or (b) ""the existence of a transaction under a Confirmation"". Conclusion: Whether the trading relationship was established under a Master Agreement or under the Confirmation(s) -- the ""Confidentiality"" language employed by ENA and ECC prohibits the public disclosure relating to the Master Agreement or to the Confirmation(s). Therefore, if ENA and/or ECC desire to public disclose ""the existence of a Master Agreement"" or ""the existence of a transaction under a Confirmation"" -- ENA and/ECC must first secure the prior consent of any counterparty before public disclosure to third party can be made. For your convenience, attached are my findings as set forth in the following: 1. Master Agreement List for the Forest Products Trading Counterparties, along with the forms of ""Confidentiality"" provisions: << File: master agreement list (forest products counterparty).doc >> << File: confidentiality - master (standard provision).doc >> << File: confidentiality-master (non-standard provision).doc >> 2. Forest Products Trading Counterparties without a Master Agreement, along with the ""Confidentiality"" provision: << File: non master agreement list (forest products counterparty).doc >> << File: confidentiality - confirms (standard provision).doc >> If I can be of further assistance, please let me know.

Snow on Mauna Kea - January 23, 2002 Photos by Steven Parente Throughout last weekend, the Big Island was deluged with heavy rains, high surf and cool temperatures... reaching the low 60's in Hilo. Brrrrrrr. This late winter storm also brought heavy snowfall for Mauna Kea. Mauna Kea translates into white mountain, and as you view the shots you'll understand why. From the ocean floor this is the tallest mountain in the world. There was a break today, so I braved the cool Hilo morning temperatures (low 60's), went to Lili'uokalani Gardens, and took some shots of the beautiful view of Mauna Kea. Hope you enjoy! - Steve Take a look! http://www.hawaiitropicals.com/picsofhawaii.html We have some great new selections of potted orchids to look at as well. Like the Chieftain"" Wild Warrior Orchid plant Winner of the American Orchid Society's Award of Merit, this impressive plant with a mild fragrance similar to the stephanotis flower is NOW AVAILABLE! The ""Chieftain"" Wild Warrior Orchid plant is a Brassia/Oncidium mix (P.O.I.-85 Brscdm). Each plant arrives in a 4"" pot and wicker basket.

The following assumptions were made to establish our bid: 5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and withdrawal fees. Also an undiscounted June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 existed at the time of this bid.

"Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer. In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence. Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron. He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us. Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company. Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations. Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp. In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works. I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price. I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around. Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process. But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence. The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform. Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.",ham

"Dear Sir/Madam, I am well confident of your capability to assist me in a transaction for mutual benefit of both parties, ie (me and you) I am also believing that you will not expose or betray the trust and confidence I am about to establish with you. I have decided to contact you with greatest delight and personal respect. Well, I am VICTOR SANKOH, Son to Mr.FODAY SANKOH who was arrested by the ECOMOG PEACE KEEPING FORCE months ago in my country Sierra Leone. Few days before the arrest of my father, he confided in me and ordered me to go to his underground safe and move out immediately, with a Deposit Agreement and Cash Receipt he made with a security Company in Abidjan Cote d'Ivoire where he deposited One Iron Box containing USD$ 22 million dollars cash (Twenty Two Million dollars). This money was made from the sell of Gold and Diamond by my FATHER and he have already decided to use this money for future investment of the family before his arrest. Thereafter, I rushed down to Abidjan with these documents and confirmed the deposit of the box by my father. Also, I have been granted political stay as a Refugee by the Government of C�te d'Ivoire. Meanwhile, my father have instructed me to look for a trusted foreigner who can assist me to move out this money from C�te d'Ivoire immediately for investment . Based on this , I solicit for your assistance to transfer this fund into your Account, but I will demand for the following requirement: (1) Could you provide for me a safe Bank Account where this fund will be transferred to in your country or another neaarby country where taxation will not takegreat toll on the money? (2) Could you be able to assist me to obtain my travelling papers after this transfer to enable me come over to meet you in your country for theinvestment of this money? (3) Could you be able to introduce me to a profitable business venture that would not require much technical expertise in your country where part of this fund willbe invested? Please, all these requirements are urgently needed as it will enable me to establish a stronger business relationship with you hence I will like you to be the general overseer of the investment thereafter. I am a Christian and I will please, want you to handle this transaction based on the trust I have established on you. For your assistance in this transaction, I have decided to offer you 12% percent commission of the total amount at the end of this business. The security of this business is very important to me and as such, I would like you to keep this business very confidential. I shall be expecting your urgent reply. Thank you and God bless you.

We want a reliable person who could assist us in the transfer the sum of Twenty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars ( $20,500,000 ).

We are left with the balance US$20.5M as part of the over-invoiced amount which we have deliberated over estimated for our own use.

We have been exercising patience for this opportunity for so long and to most of us this is a life time opportunity we cannot afford to miss. We have agreed to COMPENSATE you duly if agreement is reached by both of us and I and one of my colleagues involved in this deal will come to your country to arrange for our share, upon the confirmation from you that the Certified International Bank Draft has been Approved and Raised in your favor. Consequent upon your acceptance of this proposal, kindly confirm your interest by Telephone to me, through my Direct Tel No: +873-762-692484.

"FROM: COL. MICHAEL BUNDU. DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO. Tel No: Your country Intl. access code +8821652098236 email : mikebundu@rediffmail.com Dear Sir/Madam SEEKING YOUR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE. Please permit me to make your acquaintance in so informal a manner. This is necessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable and trust worthy foreign partner. This request may seem strange and unsolicited but I crave your indulgence and pray that you view it seriously. My name is COL. MICHAEL BUNDU of the Democratic Republic of Congo and one of the close aides to the former President of the Democratic Republic of Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessed memory, may his soul rest in peace. Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to force out the rebels in my country, I and some of my colleagues were instructed by Late President Kabila to go abroad to purchase arms and ammunition worth of Twenty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebel group. We were then given this money privately by the then President, LAURENT KABILA, without the knowledge of other Cabinet Members. But when President Kabila was killed in a bloody shoot-out by one of his bodyguards a day before we were schedule to travel out of Congo, We immediately decided to put the funds into a private security company here in Congo for safe keeping. The security of the said amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest and seizure of properties of Col. Rasheidi Karesava (One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) a tribesman, and some other Military Personnel from our same tribe, by the new President of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the son of late President Laurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila. In view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who can assist us to move this money out of my country as the beneficiary. WE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' here to move the fund under Diplomatic Cover to a security company in Europe in your name. This is to ensure that the Diplomatic Baggage is marked ''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it will not pass through normal custom/airport screening and clearance. Our inability to move this money out of Congo all this while stems from our lack of trust of our supposed good friends (western countries) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked with the late President Kabila, immediately after his son took office. Though we have neither seen nor met each other, the information We gathered from an associate who has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that with your sincere assistance, this transaction will be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within two weeks. The said money is a state fund and therefore requires a total confidentiality. We would please need you to stand on our behalf as the beneficiary of this fund in Europe. This is because we are under restricted movement and watch and hence we want to be very careful in order not to lose this fund which we have worked so hard for. Thus, if you are willing to assist us to move this fund out of Congo, you can contact me through my email addresses, Tel/Fax nos. above with your telephone, fax number and personal information to enable us discuss the modalities and what will be your share (percentage) for assisting us. Please note that There are no RISKS involved in this Deal as everyone's Security is Guaranteed if we follow the required guidelines. I will hence furnish you with further details of this Deal as soon as I am assured of your Sincere interest to assist us. I must use this opportunity and medium to implore you to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily confidential, Whatever your decision, while I await your prompt response. Thank you and God Bless. Best Regards COL. MICHAEL BUNDU(RTD). m_bundu@rediffmail.com N\B. When you are calling my line, you dial your country Intl. access code, then you dial directly, do not include my country code i.e. (243). Just dial your country Intl. access code + 88216 52098236.

"Hello You may have seen this business before and ignored it. I know I did - many times! However, please take a few moments to read this letter. I was amazed when the profit potential of this business finally sunk in... and it works! With easy-to-use e-mail tools and opt-in e-mail, success in this business is now fast, easy and well within the capabilities of ordinary people who know little about internet marketing. And the earnings potential is truly staggering! I'll make you a promise. READ THIS E-MAIL TO THE END! - follow what it says to the letter - and you will not worry whether a RECESSION is coming or not, who is President, or whether you keep your current job or not. Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never responded to one of these before either. One day though, something just said: ""You throw away $25.00 going to a movie for 2 hours with your wife. What the heck."" Believe me, no matter where you believe those ""feelings"" come from, I thank every day that I had that feeling. I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be doing had I not. Read on. It's true. Every word of it. It is legal. I checked. Simply because you are buying and selling something of value. AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV: Making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home. THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET! ================================================== BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!! Before you say ""Bull"", please read the following. This is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it really can make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal. Their findings proved once and for all that there are ""absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can 'follow the simple instructions' they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $25 out of pocket cost"". DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. This is what one had to say: ""Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received a total $610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in."" Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey. ================================================== Another said: ""This program has been around for a long time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything."" More testimonials later but first, ======= ==== PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE ==== $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ If you would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read the following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!! $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED! INSTRUCTIONS: =====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below ===== For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems. ===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER, MAKE SURE === ===YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! === You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00. Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer. IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is instructed below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out on the majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this works, you will also see how it will not work if you change it. Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter it, it will NOT work!!! People have tried to put their friends'/relatives' names on all five thinking they could get all the money. But it does not work this way. Believe us, some have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than what is instructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you. Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a product for sale and getting paid for it. Treat it as such and you will be VERY profitable in a short period of time. 1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune. 2.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5. 3.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4. 4.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3. 5.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2 6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position. PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY! This is critical to YOUR success. ================================================== **** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. Save this on a disk as well just in case you lose any data. To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 primary methods to get this venture going: METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY ================================================== Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume you and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better but let's just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only 5,000 each. Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's 100 people who responded and ordered Report # 2. Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4. Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report # 5. THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00 (half a million dollars). Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00 NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY! ================================================== REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting, with thousands more coming online every day. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more! METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET ================================================== Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all orders. This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and address on it, will be prompt because they cannot advertise until they receive the report. ===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ==================== The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is illegal or somehow ""wrong"". It is simply about time. Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you. ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address.

I am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old 'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'."" Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois ================================================ ""Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative as I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back. I was surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big."" Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada ================================================= ""I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone else......... 11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the money came within 22 weeks."" Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y. ================================================= ""It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made $20, in the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of the third month my total cash count was $362,840.00. Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet.""

"THE ULTIMATE WAY TO WORK FROM HOME THE BEST MONEY MAKING SYSTEM OF ALL!! AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV As seen on 20/20 and many other credible references. This is NOT a scam. I hope this is ok that I send you this. If you aren't interested, just simply delete it. READ THIS MESSAGE if you are like me and want more than your lousy weekly paycheck. Make more in a few months than last year at work. Believe it, work it. This really works, don't make the same mistake I made. I deleted this 4-5 times before finally giving it a try. Within 2 weeks the orders (money) started coming in just like the plan below said it would. Give it a try!! You will be glad you did. Thanks and Good Luck! You won't need luck, just keep reading. Don't delete this!!! ------------------------------------------------------ First read about how a 15 year old made $71,000. See below.... AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV: This is the media report. PARENTS OF 15 - YEAR OLD - FIND $71,000 CASH HIDDEN IN HIS CLOSET! Does this headline look familiar? Of course it does. You most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program (USA). And reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck of the woods - New Zealand). His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old sons closet. Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash. Five-dollar bills, twenties, fifties and hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labeled piles. ""My first thought was that he had robbed a bank"", says the 41-year-old woman, ""There was over $71,000 dollars in that bag -- that's more than my husband earns in a year"". The woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered. He came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up. Little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet. As it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via E-mail, a type of ""Report"" to E-mail addresses that he obtained off the Internet. Everyday after school for the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom. ""I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the heck, I put my name on it like the instructions said and I started sending it out"", says the clever 15-year-old. The E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one $5 dollar bill to each person on the list, then delete the address at the top and move the others addresses down, and finally to add your name to the top of the list. The letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in five-dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the 5-address list. ""I get junk E-mail all the time, and really did not think it was going to work"", the boy continues. Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail, the Post Office Box that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing $5 bills. ""About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post office and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it. There was also a yellow slip that said I had to go up to the [post office] counter. I thought I was in trouble or something (laughs)"". He goes on, ""I went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me. I had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all"". Over the next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the E-mail. ""The money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet, barely had time for my homework"". He had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, fifties and hundreds. ""I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack. I would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money and he was outside waiting for me. One time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it, but I just rode to the next bank down the street (laughs)."" Surprisingly, the boy did not have any reason to be afraid. The reporting news team examined and investigated the so-called ""chain-letter"" the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter at all. In fact, it was completely legal according to US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also in the code of federal regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received. Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read, ""Please send me report number XYX"".This simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a five-dollar fee. [This is the end of the media release. If you would like to understand how the system works and get your $71,000 - please continue reading. What appears below is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net - YOU CAN USE IT TOO - just follow the simple instructions]. THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET ! ================================================== You will Make over half million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home!! Before you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it really can make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal. Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can -follow the simple instructions, they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $25 out of pocket cost''. DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. This is what one had to say: '' Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received total $610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in''. Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey. ========================================================= =======Here is another testimonial: ''' this program has been around for a long time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions and wallaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that made a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything.'' More testimonials later but first: ===== PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE ======== $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ $$$$$$$$ If you would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read the following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!! $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ $$$$$$$$ FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED! INSTRUCTIONS: ================Order all 5 reports shown on the list below ================= For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems. === When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports. You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5=$25.00. Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer. IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or you will loose out on majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this works, you will also see how it does not work if you change it. Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter, it will NOT work !!! People have tried to put their friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money. But it does not work this way. Believe us, we all have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than what is instructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you. Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! 1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT #5. This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune. 2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5. 3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4. 4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3. 5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2 6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position. PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY! ========================================================= ======= **** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. Save this on a disk as well just in case you loose any data. To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going: METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY ========================================================= ======= Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each).Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1 Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100 people responded and ordered Report # 2. Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report! # 4. Whose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report # 5 THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half million). Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000 ........ Grand Total=$555,550.00 NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLERESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY ! ========================================================= ======= REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more! METHOD # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET ========================================================= ======= Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1and add METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all orders. This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report. ===================AVAILABLE REPORTS ========================== ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of paper, Write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address.

I am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving ''junk mail''. I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received total $ 147,200.00 ........... all cash! I was shocked. ! I have joined Jody in her ''hobby''.

"Socijalisticka partija Srbije, predvodjena grupom starih socijalista na celu sa Milomirem Minicem, konacno se odrekla politike i herojskog drzanja predsednika te stranke Slobodana Milosevica, saopstenjima, da jedan ,,slabo obavesten covek ne moze, pogotovu ne iz zatvorske celije upravljati tako velikom partijom kao sto je Socijalisticka partija Srbije, pa zvao se on i Slobodan Milosevic''. Socijalisti koji za sebe danas kazu da vise nisu idolopoklonici Slobodana Milosevica, neprestano, u kontaktima sa clanovima i simpatizerima te partije, pokusavaju da razdvoje odbranu Slobodana Milosevica u Hagu, od politickog zivota u Srbiji, pripisujuci Milosevicevim braniocima iz nacionalnog komiteta za oslobadjanje S. Milosevica, ,,Sloboda'' da im je cilj da uniste Socijalisticku partiju Srbije. Iako je zbog istih takvih gledista, svojevremeno najpolularniji socijalista, posle predsednika te stranke, prof. Branislav Ivkovic bio iskljucen iz redova SPS, danas rukovodstvo SPS koristi jos teze i grublje kvalifikacije na racun njihovog predsednika, pritom ne strahujuci da bi bilo ko od njih mogao biti iskljucen iz partije. Ne retko se poslednjih dana, u rokovodstvu partije cuje da partija nije Slobodan Milosevic, i da on ne predstvalja tu partiju, vec da su partija Rukovodstvo i Glavni odbor te stranke. Medjutim u clanstvu i medju simpatizerima te stranke, stvari se ne odijaju bas po planovima rukovodstva. Procene idu dotle da se na septembarskim izborima ocekuje da Bata Zivojinovic osvoji tek 1% glasova. Clanovi partije, najveci deo njih i danas veruje svom heroju, Slobodanu Milosevicu. Po clanstvu partije, ovih dana u rukovodstvu partije, oni koji su predsednika te stranke pogresno informisali poslednjih godina, kada su shvatili da im je ,,odzvonilo'' pokusavaju da sacuvaju sebe eliminacijom predsednika Slobodana Milosevica. Mladi socijalisti, kojih i nema bas mnogo, kako se SPS svojevremeno hvalio, izgleda su na strani predsednika te stranke. Tako se u nastupima na opstinskim odborima, mogu cuti uverljivi govori Dejana Stjepanovica i Igora Raicevica, i po neki Milinka Isakovica iz redova mladih socijalista, clanova organizaciono politickog odbora predsednika SPS. Obracanja ovih mladih ljudi, medju clanstvom partije imaju do deset puta vecu tezuni, nego li obracanja profesionalnih politicara koji za sobom vuku teret proslosti. Stav rukovodstva mladih socijalista, se razlikuje od stava saveta mladih, koji su takodje na strani predsednika. Branko Ruzic i Dejan Backovic, svojevremeno najveci branioci i zastupnici lika i dela Slobodana Milosevica, danas su se pretvorili u njegove najvece kriticare. Pokusavaju na sve moguce nacine da minorizuju grupu mladih koja ga podrzava. Cak se poslednjih dana cuje, da je najbolji recept da se rukovodstvo mladih odrzi ikao je protiv Sloba, da se povezu rodbinskim vezama, pa se tako predsednik mladih socijalista Beograda, Ana Djurovic udala za Branka Ruzica, predsednika Mladih socijalista Srbije, koji je za kuma uzeo Dejna Backovia, svog potpredsednika. Backovic se ovih dana zeni, jednom mladom socijalistkinjom koja je clan saveta mladih, a u isto vreme i sestra jednog od clanova IO GO SPS-a, za kuma uzima jos jednog mladog socijalistu iz Saveta mladih. Sve u svemu, mladi u SPS se drze kao italijanske mafijaske porodice 60-tih u SAD. Sta ce se do kraja price dogoditi ostaje pitanje, no clanstvo i simpatizeri ce oceniti rad svog rukovodstva na predsednickim izborima. Pimato se samo, sta ce da rade, ako im Bata prodje losije od Seselja koga je predsednik Slobodan Milosevic podrzao za predsednickog kandidat? _______________________________________________________________________ Powered by List Builder To unsubscribe follow the link: http://lb.bcentral.com/ex/sp?c=15279&s=54EE057E0B6864FB&m=5",spam

I have become aware that there is no formal distinction separating young African?Americans from the general definition of ""Generation X"". Aside from it being regarded as the generation that followed ""Baby Boomers"", it's important to point out there is no root definition for this term as well. Since the theme of this work is centered on identifying the realities and misconceptions of young African?American culture, I have chosen a definition that incorporates all of the components that were part of my birth, childhood, and young adult life. Taken from a web site entitled ""Generation X"", created and maintained by the Colorado College, the definition is as follows: ""We are a group of people born between 1961 and 1981. We are individuals who live for the 'here and now', like to experiment, and who require immediate results. We are typically selfish, and cynical, and depend a lot on our parents. We question authority, and feel like we carry the burden of the previous generations. It's that simple. It seems we have come to be called ""Xer's"" simply because we represent something negative to our elders. We may be the one thing all of the generations that precede us have in common, that is the ability to speak assuredly about our shortcomings. Of course, they overlook the fact that we are their responsibility, or actually their fault. Our generation will be called upon to look after our parents knowing they failed to look after us. Intergenerational justice failed somewhere along the way and it will be our task to either rectify it or make it worse."" ""We are a group of individuals who grew up with no one at home after school. It appears we have little hope for the future. No jobs, no homes, and basically no money are almost expected of us. These bleak prospects, along with the fact that we will be forced to support the largest amount of senior citizens ever, do not provide much hope. Some believe that these blockades will be too much for us to handle and we will for the most part fail at life, but many see our individualism and resourcefulness that has been built up through our childhood, as our saviors. We will soon discover who is right and who is wrong."" This definition is important because it demonstrates the widely held belief that Generation X is comprised of one core group of American citizens. It over generalizes the similarities it expresses, and applies them to all those who were born within the corresponding years. When in fact these ""similarities"" speak primarily to only ""white"" issues and concerns. For instance, ""they"" say ""we"" depend a lot on our parents, but in ghetto America ""we"" could only depend on one our mothers! ""They"" also say, "" . . .we feel like we carry the burden of previous generations,"" and "" . . . we will be forced to support the largest amount of senior citizens ever."" In ghetto America, no one ever gives these issues any thought because survival is in the here and now, and is all ""we"" have time for. I have known for many years that the differences that separate Generation Xer's black and white occupants would eventually be identified. I never knew I would be the one doing it. Extracting the ""Black"" from ""Generation X"" and categorizing it for its own sake is a necessary and important contingency. Without doing so, the social ills that plague Ghetto America would be lost within the generalities that are explained away as part of a collective American identity. There are many hidden truths that exist in black America today. ""White America"" charges that we spend our time collecting welfare, refusing to vote, reading elementary styled books, watching music videos, day dreaming of becoming rappers, basketball players, selling drugs, and making babies. Much of this is supported in Marlon Riggs's documentary entitled ""Ethnic Notions."" When African Americans are mentioned, whites typically envision an image that is strikingly similar to the one that graces the cover of this book. A reality that I confirmed while watching ""Roger & Me,"" another documentary written, and directed by Michael Moore. Sadly, many of us have begun to validate this skewed image, while others bend over backwards in an attempt to pretend we do nothing of the kind, only to be contradicted and embarrassed when presented with the daily programming line up for B.E.T. (Black Entertainment Television). Many of us fail to realize, that whatever embarrassment or shame the ex posed truth may reveal, should be taken as an opportunity to improve, empower, enlighten, and ultimately change anyone who is guilty of perpetrating this kind of behavior. Regarding Black Women: I have known many in my life and although each has had unique attitudes and personalities, I began to notice the majority of them shared the same collective mentality toward black men as a whole-that black men owed them something, and are required to provide and fulfill what was missing from their lives, be it emotional, physical, or economical. Normally that type of assertion would not warrant opposition from me, so long as a reciprocal attitude was extended. In most cases, it has not been. It's funny though, looking back, I am surprised I never paid any attention to the beliefs and attitudes that different black women subscribe to, or the various schools of thought they possessed. Many have placed strict demands and presumptions on the African?American male, some fair and some unfair. Much of what the public believes and understands about the black female's social structure is often filtered by others in the black community who believe these inaccurate and frequently positive representations will somehow change the reality that is. What originally sparked my attention was an observation I stumbled upon while skimming through and reading books related to black male and female interaction. I noticed virtually all of the books I read in the genre depict an inaccurate and misleading concentration on the affluent African?American perspective. These stories and commentaries tend to suggest that all African?Americans thrive on a middle?to?upper class professional level. They relay stories of relationship problems with ""Huxtable?like"" bachelors and bachelorettes whose only concern is why the other has not confessed his or her love. As I read these stories I couldn't help but become irritated by the blatant omission of the prevailing majority of blue collar or ""working class"" African?Americans. Although there are those in the black community that can identify with the ""Huxtable?like"" dynamic, unfortunately, they are few and far between. The majority of stories I have read seem to be geared toward fantasizing and romanticizing the oppressive state of affairs that have plagued Black America. The black authors who have written these books fear the potential backlash awaiting anyone who would dare air out our ""dirty laundry"". The fact is, truth should never be stifled by fear of any kind. I recently had a candid conversation with some very dear female friends who stated that although they fully acknowledge the terrible state of affairs many of our women are currently drowning in, they felt that publicizing their predicament would be viewed as a form of betrayal. As our discussion intensified, I reminded them that the only way change can be effected is by increasing public awareness that change is needed, and oftentimes, not exposing the truth can be more crippling than the truth itself. The purpose of my book is in essence an attempt to change the self?destructive thinking and self?imprisoning behavior that ""black male and female generation X"" have been subscribing to. While discussing this with my friend, she suggested I simplify my writing style so my potential black readers could better understand what I'm attempting to convey. Acknowledging the real possibility of my message being misunderstood, I suggest to those readers that if they want to fully appreciate the finer points of this narrative-to grab a dictionary. (Don't feel bad-there were several times I had to as well!) Regarding Black Men: An overwhelming number of us have become preoccupied with being cool, buying sports wear, driving expensive cars, wearing gold or platinum jewelry, and often without legitimate personal wealth and while living under the most deplorable conditions! I have chosen to address this rarely acknowledged side of African?American culture because I have lived it. I have seen the chaos and futility that exists on this level. It is a world of ignorance, selfishness, pre?occupation, and idiocy. In my world there are people who applaud a lack of education, who brag about having served time in U.S. penitentiaries, the types of guns they carry, dope peddling, and chasing women. They champion the notion of having children without any regard to the poor environment many of them currently inhabit. In this world, wearing expensive clothes and carrying fancy handbags is mandatory even if it means spending their last dollar in order to look like they've got a million. It's a world where children dress in over?priced sports wear, mimicking and idolizing whatever popular athlete or rapper is currently in the public eye. Thinking, such as the belief that fancy clothes are what define one's self?worth, and the possible corruption this thinking breeds, seems to not be an important concern for black mothers. It may come as a shock to know that most African?Americans feel that those who don't have the same, if not better, material possessions, are lesser beings, referring to them as being corny, lame, or broke. Even our ""male rapper"" entertainers promote backward priorities-nothing else matters as long as you look good. ""The Big Tymers"", a popular rap duo, have a song called ""I'm Still Fly"", shown in heavy rotation on B.E.T. and played regularly on black radio stations throughout the country. (""Fly"" is ghetto vernacular for well dressed, also used to describe a female's beauty). Its signature verse asserts: ""I got gator boots with a pimped out Gucci Suit, can't pay my rent cause all my money's spent, but that's O.K. cause I'm still fly."" Worse yet, in the song ""Grinding"", the popular duo ""Eclipse"" glorifies the selling of illegal drugs in inner city neighborhoods as children play and dance throughout the entire video. (The term ""grinding"" is ghetto vernacular for the selling of illegal drugs) The fact that this song and video is also shown in heavy rotation on B.E.T. is further evidence that our world is in utter turmoil. Some of the key lyrics to this song are ""grindingyou know what I keep in the lining"" (the area in their coats where they hide illegal drugs) and ""Patty cake Patty cake I'm the bakers man I bake them cakes as fast as I can and you can tell cause of how my bread stack up and I disguise it as rap so the feds backup"" In this verse, the group refers to the process of cooking cocaine and its transformation into cocaine base or crack. When created it is compressed into the form of a large cookie with the average diameter being the size of a typical cake. (hence the term ""cake"" or sometimes ""pie"") Unfortunately for the rap genre, this song seems to strengthen the long standing argument posed by most whites that rap music is nothing more than an entertainment medium catering to violent drug offenders, who want and do nothing more than carry guns and break the law. The negative references I've identified have become an integral part of the urban African?American existence. This mutated reality is ridiculous and unacceptable. This ideology should not be permitted to continue any longer than it already has. There is an overwhelming part of the African?American community that is aware of this crippling mentality. There are also many that are unaware and unfortunately, more that do not even care. Those of us who are in the know have a responsibility to educate and enlighten those of us who are not aware of the negative behavior being perpetrated daily. Whether because of habit or misguided values, this type of ideology is cyclical and thrives off of ignorance. It should be apparent to us all that we cannot wait for some other race to come and save us. We must save ourselves! I am well aware that many of you are probably furious by now, and are thinking, what right do I have to express the opinions I have thus far, as well as those I have al luded too. I have chosen to chronicle my experiences because of the diversity and seriousness of their content. There is far too much negativity thriving within our culture. There must be acknowledgment and accountability for the truth, whether good or bad. I am aware that not all of ""us"" have succumbed to the crippling mentality that is rampant in our community, and I have chosen to concentrate on individuals who have had a profound impact on my life. Any similarities and generalizations I illustrate are directed solely toward individuals in the black community who share the collective negative thinking and behavior that will hereafter be identified. Additionally, throughout this book I will refer to African?Americans in four different ways; the first being ""African?Americans"", denoting our status as citizens in the United States; secondly, as ""Black"", a reference that identifies and defines our differences and struggles in this country; third, as ""Niggas,"" a term which is often misunderstood and should not be confused with ""Nigger"". The term ""nigga"" has become an accepted form of reference among young black males used to express friendship (hence the term ""My Nigga"") as well as a blanket reference when speaking to, of, or about other black males in a non?personal manner. I felt it necessary to make this distinction because many of the experiences I will refer to mandate the use of the term to effectively communicate the attitude and mood that existed during the time each story took place; and fourth, as ""Ghetto"", this term is largely intended as an internal reference commonly understood by blacks as a means to define the less polished members of our community. It is important to note that the use of either term has no negative connotation and is therefore not to be associated with any feeling as such. My commentary is based on real?life situations, both good and bad, and how one African?American man was affected by them. To that end, I feel it is necessary to acknowledge that my intention is not to condemn the individuals I have encountered. Despite the negativity they have displayed, I only want to make them aware that the selfish and self debasing attitudes they subscribed to, in many ways, has caused them to become their own worst enemy. In the case of the black female's negative and limited perspective toward black men, the world, and subconsciously themselves, I submit that this mentality is perhaps single?handedly responsible for the lack of success, happiness, and quality of life that is at the center of every African?American woman's fantasy quest. It is also important to note that the selfish and negative attitudes at the core of the tension that exists between black women and men, has been deliberately created by ""White America"". For example, much of the existing resentment between black women and men can be traced as far back as slavery on up to present day. Many past issues have taken on new identities and have re?emerged in the form of corporate acceptance of black women and the corporate exclusion of black men. The resulting economic independence that some black women now enjoy has caused them to challenge and judge the black man for his absence within corporate America, without realizing and ackno wledging that this absence is by design. There are other ""core"" issues that have been passed down and nurtured from generation to generation, such as color barriers, light skin versus dark skin, good hair versus bad hair, loyalty, devotion, and economic status. Believe it or not, there was once a time when black women refused to date a black man if he didn't sell drugs or was not ""thugged out"". (a term for being rough or hoodlum-like) The reasoning behind it being that the ""thug,"" and ""drug dealer"" lifestyle was synonymous with financial independence. These issues, among others, relate directly to the confused mentality that exists within our internal society. Sadly that ""confused mentality"" is responsible for much of the neglect the African American ""ghetto"" community receives at the hands of our more affluent brethren. Who have locked it away in the basement, and seems to be more concerned with convincing the rest of the world that ""ghetto America does not exist. Furthermore, the lack of acknowledgement of which I speak should not be confused with the impoverished masses of the African American community. Their plight is a well-known reality, but in many cases much of ghetto America falls under that same umbrella. Be advised: this book is not a colorful or lighthearted look into ""Black America"". Rather it should be viewed as a legitimate tool for identifying and changing the backward thinking that so many young African Americans (including myself) have come to perpetuate. Moreover, that ""backward thinking"" is the main cause of our inability to strive for a common goal. An outcome that must be met; and can only be met, with Godly faith, positive strategy, cooperation, love, loyalty, self and mutual respect. ************************************************************* To read More go to www.blackrealitypublishing.com To Unsubscribe: send mail to majordomo@FreeBSD.org with ""unsubscribe freebsd-ports"" in the body of the message",spam

"KEVIN GEORGE ABIDJAN,COTE D'IVORIE WEST AFRICA Dearest one, Although we have not met, I got your contact through the internet and decided to contact you for assistance. I was, until recently, a final year engineering student of the University of Sierra Leone,West Africa. Early in January last year, the rebels in my country struck our township and killed my parents in one of their attacks. My late father, King Christopher George being the King of the Town was a prime target. Fortunately for me, I was in school when the attack took place. I equally lost my only sister to the rebels. When I got home for the remains of my parents and the subsequent burial that followed, I discovered a document indicating that my late father had deposited some $6M.United States Dollars(six million united states dollars) with one of the private security company here in abidjan cote d'ivorie. This money, according to the docement, was meant for the building of an Auto repair company for me by my late father,when I complete my studies. Upon the discovery of this document, I travelled to the cote d'ivorie to trace the concerned security company and to make claims for the said money as the only surviving next of kin to my father. But deliberatley, I have decided to keep all my uncles and Aunts out of the issue as none of them will be happy to know I am in possession of such money. I have succeded in making the people at the security company believe that I am the next of Kin and all the documents related to are now with me. I do not know what to do with it but I have decided to contact you to seek your assistance in helping me to take it outfrom the security company and transfer it to your account and help me to come to your country to continue my education and so that you will help me to get the money invested until such a time that I will be ready to begin to use it. I am really desperate as I am left alone now in the world.Let me know what you want as compensation for helping me to solve this my problem. Most importantly,Iseriously appeal that you maintain high level of secrecy and confidentiality in the whole thing. Please you can call me wilth is number 00225-075-03684 I remain yours sincerely, KEVIN GEORGE --------------------------------- Yahoo! Mail -- Une adresse @yahoo.fr gratuite et en français !",spam

"ilug , From;Mr.Michael Kamah and Family, Johannesburg,South Africa. My Dear , Good day.This very confidential request should come as a surprise to you.But it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you, and I quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.I got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes. My name is Mr.Michael Kamah, the second son of Mr.Smith Kamah, of Beitbridge Zimbabwe.At the height of the present political crises in our country,in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president,Mr.Robert G.Mugabe,in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13th of february,2002, in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.My father,during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .He publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by Mr.Robert Mugabe and his followers,which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts.That not being enough,the president and his followers after winning the last undemocratic elections decided to block and ! confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes[that included my fathers assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers,along with the assets of these white farmers themselves,that are being presently confiscated.I therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the Republic of South Africa,where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood. During my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of Eight Million and Six Hundred Thousand United States Dollars[$8.600.000.00],in a trunk box with a Finance and Security Company in the Republic of Togo for a cash and carry Diamond and Gold business with some foreign business customers, awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination,which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day.In view of this and as the only surviving son of my father,and with the present clamp down,killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country,I therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of Africa finally,to the Europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and blocked by the present Mugabe's! regime.My mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit. Now this is what I actually want you to do for me; 1. I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office. 2. To finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years. Please,I hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now,and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.And also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,I emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request. Best Regards, Mr.Michael Kamah and family. -- Irish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie http://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.

"Socijalisticka partija Srbije, predvodjena grupom starih socijalista na celu sa Milomirem Minicem, konacno se odrekla politike i herojskog drzanja predsednika te stranke Slobodana Milosevica, saopstenjima, da jedan ,,slabo obavesten covek ne moze, pogotovu ne iz zatvorske celije upravljati tako velikom partijom kao sto je Socijalisticka partija Srbije, pa zvao se on i Slobodan Milosevic''. Socijalisti koji za sebe danas kazu da vise nisu idolopoklonici Slobodana Milosevica, neprestano, u kontaktima sa clanovima i simpatizerima te partije, pokusavaju da razdvoje odbranu Slobodana Milosevica u Hagu, od politickog zivota u Srbiji, pripisujuci Milosevicevim braniocima iz nacionalnog komiteta za oslobadjanje S. Milosevica, ,,Sloboda'' da im je cilj da uniste Socijalisticku partiju Srbije. Iako je zbog istih takvih gledista, svojevremeno najpolularniji socijalista, posle predsednika te stranke, prof. Branislav Ivkovic bio iskljucen iz redova SPS, danas rukovodstvo SPS koristi jos teze i grublje kvalifikacije na racun njihovog predsednika, pritom ne strahujuci da bi bilo ko od njih mogao biti iskljucen iz partije. Ne retko se poslednjih dana, u rokovodstvu partije cuje da partija nije Slobodan Milosevic, i da on ne predstvalja tu partiju, vec da su partija Rukovodstvo i Glavni odbor te stranke. Medjutim u clanstvu i medju simpatizerima te stranke, stvari se ne odijaju bas po planovima rukovodstva. Procene idu dotle da se na septembarskim izborima ocekuje da Bata Zivojinovic osvoji tek 1% glasova. Clanovi partije, najveci deo njih i danas veruje svom heroju, Slobodanu Milosevicu. Po clanstvu partije, ovih dana u rukovodstvu partije, oni koji su predsednika te stranke pogresno informisali poslednjih godina, kada su shvatili da im je ,,odzvonilo'' pokusavaju da sacuvaju sebe eliminacijom predsednika Slobodana Milosevica. Mladi socijalisti, kojih i nema bas mnogo, kako se SPS svojevremeno hvalio, izgleda su na strani predsednika te stranke. Tako se u nastupima na opstinskim odborima, mogu cuti uverljivi govori Dejana Stjepanovica i Igora Raicevica, i po neki Milinka Isakovica iz redova mladih socijalista, clanova organizaciono politickog odbora predsednika SPS. Obracanja ovih mladih ljudi, medju clanstvom partije imaju do deset puta vecu tezuni, nego li obracanja profesionalnih politicara koji za sobom vuku teret proslosti. Stav rukovodstva mladih socijalista, se razlikuje od stava saveta mladih, koji su takodje na strani predsednika. Branko Ruzic i Dejan Backovic, svojevremeno najveci branioci i zastupnici lika i dela Slobodana Milosevica, danas su se pretvorili u njegove najvece kriticare. Pokusavaju na sve moguce nacine da minorizuju grupu mladih koja ga podrzava. Cak se poslednjih dana cuje, da je najbolji recept da se rukovodstvo mladih odrzi ikao je protiv Sloba, da se povezu rodbinskim vezama, pa se tako predsednik mladih socijalista Beograda, Ana Djurovic udala za Branka Ruzica, predsednika Mladih socijalista Srbije, koji je za kuma uzeo Dejna Backovia, svog potpredsednika. Backovic se ovih dana zeni, jednom mladom socijalistkinjom koja je clan saveta mladih, a u isto vreme i sestra jednog od clanova IO GO SPS-a, za kuma uzima jos jednog mladog socijalistu iz Saveta mladih. Sve u svemu, mladi u SPS se drze kao italijanske mafijaske porodice 60-tih u SAD. Sta ce se do kraja price dogoditi ostaje pitanje, no clanstvo i simpatizeri ce oceniti rad svog rukovodstva na predsednickim izborima. Pimato se samo, sta ce da rade, ako im Bata prodje losije od Seselja koga je predsednik Slobodan Milosevic podrzao za predsednickog kandidat? _______________________________________________________________________ Powered by List Builder To unsubscribe follow the link: http://lb.bcentral.com/ex/sp?c=15279&s=90B245569C3B981A&m=4",spam

"It was the Spring of 1979. I was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school with buck-teeth and freckles. Each day in the cafeteria, I walked from table to table ... Stealing other kids' lunch money. No, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made them a little deal. ""Let me borrow two dollars today,"" I said, ""and I'll bring you five dollars next week."" The investment was too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes. Of course when ""next week"" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash, I promised to pay them even more the week after that, if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit longer. Eventually the end of the year came and went, high school started and with it came girls, and homework, and parties, and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more things on their mind than last year's lunch money. I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid, and I didn't even get beat up. Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market secrets you will ever learn. First of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're not going to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when you're ahead. Don't wait for the boat to sink before grabbing the lifejacket. Second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind. They are looking out for their own money, not yours. The ""professionals"", those stuffy investment counselors and money managers, will always tell you that the best time to buy is NOW. According to those guys, the longer you keep your money in the market, the more money you're going to make. Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is ""NEVER"". In a sense, they are right. If you put $250,000 in an index fund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollars in thirty or forty years. But here's the problem: Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich? Hell no! You want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard to make use of your fortune when you're seventy years old in a wheelchair. If you could make a million dollars in the next few years, what would you do with it? Where would you travel? What kind of car would you buy? The fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich. If your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility is your ally, and stability your enemy. You want to see those large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed by the four hundred point crash a week later. You don't care if the market went up or down 20% this year as long it was UNSTABLE. That's how you're going to make the money. What I'm talking about here is day trading. My father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks and he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years he makes money. The day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a $25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade. He acts quickly, taking advantage of all the information at his disposal about a certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or down within hours, sometimes within minutes. I can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing amounts of money at it. It's not rocket science, and you only need to learn a few basic principles to get started. Society would have you believe that successful trading is complicated and requires formal training. The truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment strategies to make money. Popular media and investment professionals portray successful trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing ring. They don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell don't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm to execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty dollars. They make their money only if you believe two lies: 1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average person. 2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks per trade. Here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely, positively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ... The strategies for profitable day trading are in fact so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend a few hours of studying. After reading over 200 financial books and publications during the past decade, and after using day trading to successfully make more than four million dollars in the stock market, I've learned the following lessons: ** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple. ** Anyone can do it. ** It only takes a few hours to learn. When I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn't become wealthy overnight. If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. Buy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through hard work, knowledge, and determination. After learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks brought modest gains. The next few months gave me the practical experience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling close to a six figure income. In less than three years with no formal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk, I had made my first million. The knowledge that I gained during those formative trading years I am willing to share with you in my new book, the Master Trader. You will learn from my mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple, secret formula for day trading that I've used profitably year after year. The income of the day trader can be staggering. Thousands, even hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within minutes. The difference between making money and losing your shirt is simply this: knowledge. I will provide that knowledge, and I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. Average Income of a Day Trader: 5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year 22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year 35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. 27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year 11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year After reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely profitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you win DESPITE the current market weakness. Here is just a snippet of what I will teach you: *** Make money whether a stock goes up or down. *** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds. *** Learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to buy them and the exact price to sell them. *** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the mistakes beginners make. *** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money consistently in every market! *** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance for great success. *** Profit on huge intraday price swings. *** Make money on the biggest news stories. *** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum returns. *** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street professionals use. *** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind. It's time to ask yourself: ""Am I going to listen to the Professionals who say BUY BUY BUY but never sell? Or am I going to take control of my own financial future, and start making money RIGHT NOW in the stock market?"" Who is looking out for your best economic interests - some wealthy Wall Street stockbroker, or yourself? With the Master Trader e-book, you will learn everything you need to know in order to get started with Day Trading ... from choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional trading strategies that make professional traders millions of dollars. The Master Trader e-book is the most comprehensive yet easy to understand and straight-forward book ever written about active trading. If you are serious about success in short term stock trading - ORDER TODAY and start paving the road to your own financial future. Oh, and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade? His high school friends laughed when he said he was going to make money in the stock market. Six years later, he bought a beach-front home on the California coast - WITH CASH. Oops, they weren't laughing anymore. In a rollercoaster market like we have today, day trading is the fastest track to wealth. If you're looking for a long-term retirement investment with no risk that goes up 5% a year, then by all means, this ain't your kind of game. But if you want the QUICKEST possible way to make a FORTUNE in the market, with the lowest element of risk, then order the MASTER TRADER e-book right now. I promise to teach you ALL of the secrets that helped me become a millionaire through successful day trading. You don't need to know anything about the market, and anyone can do it, with minimum effort. It's an easy game to win if you know how the pieces move.

"Hello You may have seen this business before and ignored it. I know I did - many times! However, please take a few moments to read this letter. I was amazed when the profit potential of this business finally sunk in... and it works! With easy-to-use e-mail tools and opt-in e-mail, success in this business is now fast, easy and well within the capabilities of ordinary people who know little about internet marketing. And the earnings potential is truly staggering! I'll make you a promise. READ THIS E-MAIL TO THE END! - follow what it says to the letter - and you will not worry whether a RECESSION is coming or not, who is President, or whether you keep your current job or not. Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never responded to one of these before either. One day though, something just said: ""You throw away $25.00 going to a movie for 2 hours with your wife. What the heck."" Believe me, no matter where you believe those ""feelings"" come from, I thank every day that I had that feeling. I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be doing had I not. Read on. It's true. Every word of it. It is legal. I checked. Simply because you are buying and selling something of value. AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV: Making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home. THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET! ================================================== BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!! Before you say ""Bull"", please read the following. This is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it really can make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal. Their findings proved once and for all that there are ""absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can 'follow the simple instructions' they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $25 out of pocket cost"". DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. This is what one had to say: ""Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received a total $610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in."" Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey. ================================================== Another said: ""This program has been around for a long time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything."" More testimonials later but first, ======= ==== PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE ==== $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ If you would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read the following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!! $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED! INSTRUCTIONS: =====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below ===== For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems. ===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER, MAKE SURE === ===YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! === You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00. Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer. IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is instructed below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out on the majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this works, you will also see how it will not work if you change it. Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter it, it will NOT work!!! People have tried to put their friends'/relatives' names on all five thinking they could get all the money. But it does not work this way. Believe us, some have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than what is instructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you. Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a product for sale and getting paid for it. Treat it as such and you will be VERY profitable in a short period of time. 1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune. 2.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5. 3.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4. 4.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3. 5.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2 6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position. PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY! This is critical to YOUR success. ================================================== **** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. Save this on a disk as well just in case you lose any data. To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 primary methods to get this venture going: METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY ================================================== Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume you and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better but let's just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only 5,000 each. Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's 100 people who responded and ordered Report # 2. Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4. Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report # 5. THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00 (half a million dollars). Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00 NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY! ================================================== REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting, with thousands more coming online every day. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more! METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET ================================================== Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all orders. This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and address on it, will be prompt because they cannot advertise until they receive the report. ===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ==================== The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is illegal or somehow ""wrong"". It is simply about time. Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you. ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address. PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW : ================================================== REPORT # 1: ""The Insider's Guide To Advertising for Free On The Net"" Order Report #1 from: Robert Borowczyk ul. J. Olbrachta 118C m. 28 01-373 Warsaw Poland ______________________________________________________ REPORT # 2: ""The Insider's Guide To Sending Bulk Email On The Net"" Order Report # 2 from: Mohammad Faraziyan Engelbertstr. 25 40233 Düsseldorf Germany ______________________________________________________ REPORT # 3: ""Secret To Multilevel Marketing On The Net"" Order Report # 3 from: Luis Pastor Apartado 81 48080 Bilbao Spain ______________________________________________________ REPORT # 4: ""How To Become A Millionaire Using MLM & The Net"" Order Report # 4 from: Ali Reza Auf den Holln 68 44894 Bochum Germany ______________________________________________________ REPORT # 5: ""How To Send Out One Million Emails For Free"" Order Report # 5 From: J.siden krondikesvägen 54 A 83147 Östersund Sweden ______________________________________________________ $$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$ Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success: === If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do. === After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you do not, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do. ** Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a different report. You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business !!! ================================================= FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: You have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life, with NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined. Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way. It works exceedingly well as it is now. Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and address in Report #1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 as instructed above. One of the people you send this to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them. Remember though, the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach. So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials and opportunity to become financially independent. IT IS UP TO YOU NOW ! =============MORE TESTIMONIALS=============== ""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old 'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'."" Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois ================================================ ""Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative as I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back. I was surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big."" Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada ================================================= ""I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone else......... 11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the money came within 22 weeks."" Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y. ================================================= ""It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made $20, in the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of the third month my total cash count was $362,840.00. Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet.""

"OFFICE OF:EGNR. FEMI DANIEL FEDERAL MINISTRY OF WORKS AND HOUSING FEDERAL SECRETARIAT OFFICE COMPLEX IKOYI-LAGOS. ATTN:, First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction, this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret as you were introduced to me in confidence through the Nigeria Chamber of Commerce and Industries. We are top officials from the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing,(FMW&H), Federal Ministry of Finance and the Presidency, making up the Contract Review Panel(CRP) set up by the Federal Government of Nigeria to review contracts awarded by the past military administration. In the course of our work on the CRP, we discovered this fund which resulted from grossly over - invoiced contracts which were executed for the FMW&H during the last administration.The companies that executed the contracts have been duly paid and the contracts commissioned leaving the sum of US$21.4 Million floating in the escrow account of the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for payment. I have therefore been mandated as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel to look for an overseas partner to whom we could transfer the sum of US21.4 legally subcontracting the entitlement to your company.This is bearing in mind that our civil service code of conduct forbids us from owning foreign companies or operating foreign accounts while in government service, hence the need for an overseas partner. We have agreed that the funds will be shared thus after it has been paid into your account. (1) 30% of the money will go to you for acting as the beneficiary of the fund. (2) 10% has been set aside as an abstract projection for reimbursement to both parties for incidental expences that may be incurred in the course of the transaction. (3) 60% to us the government officials (with which we intend to commence an importation business in conjunction with you) All logistics are in place and all modalities worked out for the smooth conclusion of the transaction within ten to fourteen days of commencement after receipt of the following information; your full names, company's name, address,details & activities, telephone & fax numbers.These information will enable us make the applications and lodge claims to the concerned ministries & agencies in favour of your company and it is pertinent to state here that this transaction is entirely based on trust as the solar bank draft or certified cheque drawable in any of the Central Bank of Nigeria correspondent bankers around the world is going to be made in your name. Please acknowledge the reciept of this letter using the above e-mail or the Alternative: femi1855@aol.com to reply me. Yours faithfully, Egnr. Femi Daniel.

"Hi - ( http://club.4tfox.com ) You get emails every day, offering to show you how to make money. Most of these emails are from people who are NOT making any money. And they expect you to listen to them? Enough. If you want to make money with your computer, then you should hook up with a group that is actually DOING it. We are making a large, continuing income every month. What's more - we will show YOU how to do the same thing. This business is done completely by internet and email, and you can even join for free to check it out first. If you can send an email, you can do this. No special ""skills"" are required. How much are we making? Anywhere from $2000 to $9000 per month. We are real people, and most of us work at this business part-time. But keep in mind, we do WORK at it - I am not going to insult your intelligence by saying you can sign up, do no work, and rake in the cash. That kind of job does not exist.

"INVESTMENT SCHOLARS CLUB- bringing you the latest from the financial epicenter. Research Alert - Undervalued August 26, 2002 XrayMedia (OTCBB: XRMD) Alert Rating = 8 Congratulations to our subscribers who moved in fast on our last report! Pick #1 - Internet incubator giant CMGI has paid off very well, up over 150% on major volume and great news. Pick #2 - ENBC Began its' heavy move up over 200% hitting a high of over 300%... Our Latest Discovery: XRMD - Several investment reporters featured XrayMedia during fiscal 2001/02. At the time, we felt that the advertising industry created a huge opportunity for the company's direct sourcing technology solutions, and so far the company has delivered. Although the company has raised just $2 million in the two years it has been developing its technology, it has increased revenues sources dramatically by opening a financial services division expanding the Live Media Marketplace expected revenues to $3-5 mm during fiscal 2003, driving the line in 2004 to $15- 25 mm. This remarkable growth becomes more understandable when one views the savings that its direct sourcing model generates for advertisers and retailers. The company saves advertising buyers up to 70% in costs dramatically increasing wholesale pricing effect, by saving time & efforts, cutting telephone and faxing bills, while providing free mass sourcing opportunities for negotiating advertising buying and selling opportunities using a secure state of the art real time negotiating technology over the Internet, weve never seen anything like it! How does the company do this? XrayMedia (OTCBB: XRMD) The Company founded XrayMedia in March 2000 to create a ""mass source to advertising sector "" live negotiating technology and advertising purchase financing accents the companys strengths, serving both large and small United States and International customers with advertising opportunities delivered directly from the media and the general public. *** With the use of proprietary software, it is providing sophistication to this industry which greatly expedites orders and finds opportunities based on the users criteria which results in a savings to the advertising buyers and as well as the ad sellers which it serves. Their ""source to business model"", eliminates two levels of hindrance (sourcing and limited opportunities) and provides its customers with mass advertising choices and live negotiating that is designed give a substantially low cost base for finding the right advertising opportunity for all business with no cost. While investors have thrown money recklessly at money-losing technology companies, here is a company that will increase revenues from $1 to $25 million in three years, and grow profitability substantially with little funding. XrayMedia is among the best performing sectors since September 11th, and we feel that XrayMedia is likely to break through its 52-week high of $00.19 soon. *** Listed on the OTCBB and trading with an extremely low market valuation under 10 mm. *** It has opened accounts with over hundreds of buyers and sellers including some of the largest media buyers in the world, major retailers and smaller retailers. *** Attracting interest of major investment bankers and analysts, also a possible acquisition target at some point by major retailers. *** Received largest order of advertising financing over $500k with more contracts accumulating. *** Revenue growth is expected to be dramatic $1mm to $5mm. *** The company is expected to report a profitable quarter, to grow revenues and earnings ""substantially"" when it begins its 2003 fiscal year in January. Shares Outstanding: 83 mm Float: 5 mm Recent Price: $00.08 Year Low/High: $00.02 - $00.19 18-Month Target Price: $5.00+ Company Contact: Ray Dabney Toll free: 1(888) 777-0658 (h3)6926Zjpl7",spam

"Hello You may have seen this business before and ignored it. I know I did - many times! However, please take a few moments to read this letter. I was amazed when the profit potential of this business finally sunk in... and it works! With easy-to-use e-mail tools and opt-in e-mail, success in this business is now fast, easy and well within the capabilities of ordinary people who know little about internet marketing. And the earnings potential is truly staggering! I'll make you a promise. READ THIS E-MAIL TO THE END! - follow what it says to the letter - and you will not worry whether a RECESSION is coming or not, who is President, or whether you keep your current job or not. Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never responded to one of these before either. One day though, something just said: ""You throw away $25.00 going to a movie for 2 hours with your wife. What the heck."" Believe me, no matter where you believe those ""feelings"" come from, I thank every day that I had that feeling. I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be doing had I not. Read on. It's true. Every word of it. It is legal. I checked. Simply because you are buying and selling something of value. AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV: Making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home. THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET! ================================================== BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!! Before you say ""Bull"", please read the following. This is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it really can make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal. Their findings proved once and for all that there are ""absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can 'follow the simple instructions' they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $25 out of pocket cost"". DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. This is what one had to say: ""Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received a total $610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in."" Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey. ================================================== Another said: ""This program has been around for a long time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything."" More testimonials later but first, ======= ==== PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE ==== $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ If you would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read the following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!! $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED! INSTRUCTIONS: =====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below ===== For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems. ===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER, MAKE SURE === ===YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! === You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00. Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer. IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is instructed below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out on the majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this works, you will also see how it will not work if you change it. Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter it, it will NOT work!!! People have tried to put their friends'/relatives' names on all five thinking they could get all the money. But it does not work this way. Believe us, some have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than what is instructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you. Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a product for sale and getting paid for it. Treat it as such and you will be VERY profitable in a short period of time. 1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune. 2.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5. 3.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4. 4.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3. 5.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2 6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position. PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY! This is critical to YOUR success. ================================================== **** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. Save this on a disk as well just in case you lose any data. To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 primary methods to get this venture going: METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY ================================================== Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume you and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better but let's just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only 5,000 each. Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's 100 people who responded and ordered Report # 2. Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4. Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report # 5. THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00 (half a million dollars). Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00 NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY! ================================================== REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting, with thousands more coming online every day. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more! METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET ================================================== Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all orders. This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and address on it, will be prompt because they cannot advertise until they receive the report. ===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ==================== The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is illegal or somehow ""wrong"". It is simply about time. Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you. ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address. PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW : ================================================== REPORT # 1: ""The Insider's Guide To Advertising for Free On The Net"" Order Report #: 1 from Rui Sousa Santos P.O. Box 132 Taylors Lakes VIC 3038 Australia ______________________________________________________ REPORT # 2: ""The Insider's Guide To Sending Bulk Email On The Net"" Order Report # 2 from: Richard Moulton P.O. Box 82 Hot Springs,MT 59845 USA ___________________________________________________ REPORT # 3: ""Secret To Multilevel Marketing On The Net"" Order Report # 3 from: J.siden krondikesvägen 54 A 83147 Östersund Sweden _____________________________________________________ REPORT # 4: ""How To Become A Millionaire Using MLM & The Net"" Order Report # 4 from: Francis Kidd P.O. Box 209 Homestead,PA 15120 USA __________________________________________________ REPORT # 5: ""How To Send Out One Million Emails For Free"" Order Report # 5 From: M.J. Lee P.O. Box 19 52 Victoria Drive London SW19 6BD United Kingdom ______________________________________________________ $$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$ Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success: === If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do. === After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you do not, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do. ** Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a different report. You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business !!! ================================================= FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: You have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life, with NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined. Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way. It works exceedingly well as it is now. Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and address in Report #1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 as instructed above. One of the people you send this to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them. Remember though, the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach. So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials and opportunity to become financially independent. IT IS UP TO YOU NOW ! =============MORE TESTIMONIALS=============== ""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old 'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'."" Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois ================================================ ""Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative as I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back. I was surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big."" Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada ================================================= ""I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone else......... 11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the money came within 22 weeks."" Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y. ================================================= ""It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made $20, in the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of the third month my total cash count was $362,840.00. Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet.""

"OFFICE OF:EGNR. FEMI DANIEL FEDERAL MINISTRY OF WORKS AND HOUSING FEDERAL SECRETARIAT OFFICE COMPLEX IKOYI-LAGOS. ATTN:, First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction, this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret as you were introduced to me in confidence through the Nigeria Chamber of Commerce and Industries. We are top officials from the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing,(FMW&H), Federal Ministry of Finance and the Presidency, making up the Contract Review Panel(CRP) set up by the Federal Government of Nigeria to review contracts awarded by the past military administration. In the course of our work on the CRP, we discovered this fund which resulted from grossly over - invoiced contracts which were executed for the FMW&H during the last administration.The companies that executed the contracts have been duly paid and the contracts commissioned leaving the sum of US$21.4 Million floating in the escrow account of the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for payment. I have therefore been mandated as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel to look for an overseas partner to whom we could transfer the sum of US21.4 legally subcontracting the entitlement to your company.This is bearing in mind that our civil service code of conduct forbids us from owning foreign companies or operating foreign accounts while in government service, hence the need for an overseas partner. We have agreed that the funds will be shared thus after it has been paid into your account. (1) 30% of the money will go to you for acting as the beneficiary of the fund. (2) 10% has been set aside as an abstract projection for reimbursement to both parties for incidental expences that may be incurred in the course of the transaction. (3) 60% to us the government officials (with which we intend to commence an importation business in conjunction with you) All logistics are in place and all modalities worked out for the smooth conclusion of the transaction within ten to fourteen days of commencement after receipt of the following information; your full names, company's name, address,details & activities, telephone & fax numbers.These information will enable us make the applications and lodge claims to the concerned ministries & agencies in favour of your company and it is pertinent to state here that this transaction is entirely based on trust as the solar bank draft or certified cheque drawable in any of the Central Bank of Nigeria correspondent bankers around the world is going to be made in your name. Please acknowledge the reciept of this letter using the above e-mail or the Alternative: femi1855@aol.com to reply me. Yours faithfully, Egnr. Femi Daniel.

Because I was his family Attorney as such he confided in me with the relevant document papers relating to this deposit before he died of cardiac arrest. As a matter of fact we have concluded all arrangement with an offshore Security Company to move this money as a consignment through diplomatic means to their offshore affiliated office where you will be required to put claim to the consignment as the bonafide beneficiary of the consignment. You should know that this business is safety and 100% risk-free as it does not involve drug money or Terrorist fund.

You are required to send by e-mail immediately your Full name and Address, which I will use to draft an agreement that will guide and protect both of us in this transaction also which will be used to effect the change of ownership of the consignment to your name as the beneficiary of the consignment.

"Hi, I'm a college dropout. I work about two hours a day. I'm ambitious, but extremely lazy, and I make over $250,000 a year. Are you curious yet? In a minute I'm going to tell you my secret, it's the dirty little secret of the Internet ... You've probably heard stories about people making whopping huge money online, but you thought they were the big corporate execs, famous programmers, or boy-geniuses. Well, grasshopper, think again ... It's people like you and me that are making the real money. Yep, people like YOU AND ME! Ever since the ""dot com bubble"" burst in 1999, small-time entrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 companies look for bankruptcy lawyers. Today small business owners and ordinary folks like you and me can use the web to achieve complete financial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little work. How? By learning the most profitable marketing technique ever created - it's called BULK EMAIL. If you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then you know what bulk email is. I bet you can't click on DELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right? You might not want their product, but remember that thousands of other folks probably do. Bulk email is a percentage game - every bulker who contacts you makes a six figure income on the Internet. I guarantee it. Now let's go back to Math 101 and review some numbers ... If you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a few dollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one auction. How many people see your ad? Maybe a couple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand over a period of days. Using bulk email, YOU CAN SEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY at virtually no cost. Whether your send 100,000 emails or 100 million emails, the price is the same. ZERO! Stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when hardly anyone sees your ad! Imagine that you have a decent product with a profit margin of $20.00 on each sale. If you send an email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person in a thousand actually places an order, then you just generated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours of work. It's that simple ... All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A THOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH. The best thing is that anyone can do it. Doesn't matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old executive working from an office building in New York City. Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs. All it takes is a few days of study, plenty of ambition, and some basic familiarity with the Internet. I quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the ""Dot Com"" mania, and I've never looked back. I started with no money, no product to sell, and only the most rudimentary computer skills. I saw an opportunity and I seized it. A few years later, I bought my own home - with CASH. You don't need any money. You don't need a product. You don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience whatsoever is required. If you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that you'd jump right on it. It would be a dream come true. So what are you waiting for?! I'm going to ask you four simple questions. If you answer YES to all of them, then I can almost promise that you will make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year. Here goes ... Do you have basic experience with the web? Do you have a computer and an Internet connection? Do you have a few hours each day of free time? Do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards complete financial freedom? If you answer YES to these questions, you could be making $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your home. Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats the 9-5 daily grind! All you need is ambition and commitment. This is no ""get rich quick scheme"". You have to work to make big bucks, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do it. You're probably wondering if it's hard to get started. Don't worry, it's not! I will show you step-by-step how to start your first email campaign and how to build a booming online business. You'll be generating orders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less than seven days. Okay, so what if you don't have anything to sell? No problem!! I'll show you where to find hot products that sell like CRAAAAAAZY! Most people delay starting an Internet business because they have nothing to sell, but I'm removing that hurdle right now. After reading the Bulkbook, you can build your complete product line in less than two hours! There is NO EXCUSE not to get started! I will get you up-and-running within seven days. In fact ... I personally guarantee that you will start your own bulk email campaign less than a week after reading the Bulkbook! I'll give you a toll-free phone number to reach me 24 hours a day, seven days a week; where else will you find that level of service?! I will also include a step-by-step guide to starting your very first email campaign called ""Seven Days to Bulk Email Success"". This seperate guide contains a daily routine for you to follow with specific, exact instructions on how to get started. On day one, for example, I teach you where to find a product to sell. The next day you learn how to build a fresh mailing list. On the seventh day, you just click send! Your very first campaign is ready to go. As a special bonus, you'll recieve a FREE copy of our STEALTH MASS MAILER, a very powerful bulk email program which retails for $49.99! I'll even include 7 million email addresses absolutely FREE if you order NOW! Stop wasting your money on auction listing fees, classifieds, and banner ads - they don't work, and never will! If you are SERIOUS about making money on the Internet, bulk email is your only option. What are you waiting for? Few of us are willing to share this knowledge, but I promise to teach you everything I know about bulk emailing in this extraordinary bulk emailer's handbook ... The Bulkbook! Once again, here's the deal. You give me $29.99. I give you ALL THE TOOLS YOU NEED to become a successful, high profit bulk emailer.

Of course it does. You most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program (USA). And reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck of the woods - New Zealand). His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old sons closet. Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash. Five-dollar bills, twenties, fifties and hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labelled piles. ""My first thought was that he had robbed a bank"", says the 41-year-old woman, ""There was over $71,000 dollars in that bag --that's more than my husband earns in a year"". The woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered.He came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up. Little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet. As it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via E-mail, a type of ""Report"" to E-mail addresses that he obtained off the Internet. Everyday after school for the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom. ""I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the heck, I put my name on it like the instructions said and I started sending it out"", says the clever 15-year-old. The E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one $5 dollar bill to each person on the list, then delete the address at the top and move the others addresses Down , and finally to add your name to the top of the list. The letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in five-dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the 5-address list. ""I get junk E-mail all the time, and really did not think it was going to work"", the boy continues. Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail, the Post Office Box that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing $5 bills. ""About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post office and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it. There was also a yellow slip that said I had to go up to the [post office] counter. I thought I was in trouble or something (laughs)"". He goes on, ""I went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me. I had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all"". Over the next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the E-mail."" The money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet, barely had time for my homework"".He had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, fifties and hundreds. ""I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack. I would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money] and he was outside waiting for me.One time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it, but I just rode to the next bank down the street (laughs)."" Surprisingly, the boy did not have any reason to be afraid.The reporting news team examined and investigated the so-called ""chain-letter"" the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter at all.In fact, it was completely legal according to US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also in the code of federal regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received. Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read, ""Please send me report number XYX"".This simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a five-dollar fee. [This is the end of the media release. If you would like to understand how the system works and get your $71,000 - please continue reading. What appears below is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net - YOU CAN USE IT TOO - just follow the simple instructions]. +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ BE FINANCIALLY FREE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!! Before you say ""Bull"", please read the following. This is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it really can make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal. Their findings proved once and for all that there are ""absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can follow the simple instructions, they are bound to make some megabucks with only $25 out of pocket cost"". DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. Note* follow the directons below, I had best results the second time when I hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions. In order for all of us to be successful, many, many emails must be sent so that the returns are many. I have been extremely successful using the following company. They send out the offers, and all I do is accept money for reports, then I send back to the people as soon as possible. This is what one had to say: ""Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received total $610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in"". Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey. +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Here is another testimonial: ""This program has been around for a long time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything."" More testimonials later but first, PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE ++++ Order all 5 reports shown on the list below +++ For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems. When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports. You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer. Within a few days you will receive, vie e-mail, each of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer. IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is instructed below in step ""1 through 6"" or you will loose out on majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this works, you will also see how it does not work if you change it. Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter, it will NOT work!!! People have tried to put their friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money. But it does not work this way. Believe us, we all have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than what is instructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you. Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! 1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune. 2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT #5. 3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT #4. 4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT #3. 5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT #2 6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position. PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY! +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ **** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. Save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data. To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going: METHOD #1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each). Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That equals 100 people responded and ordered Report # 2. Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report #3. Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report #4. Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report #5. THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half million). Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 +2.....$500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000....... Grand Total=$555,550.00 NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY! +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more! METHOD #2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method #1 and add METHOD #2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all orders. This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out with your name and address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report. =ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper or aluminum foil. On one of those sheets of paper, Write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address. PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW: +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ REPORT #1: The Insider's Guide to Advertising for Free on the Net Order Report #1 from: R. R.

If you did not, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do. +++ Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report #2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a Different report. You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business!!! +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: You have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life, with NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined. Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way. It works exceedingly well as it is now. Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and address in Report#1 and moved others to #2 thru #5 as instructed above. One of the people you send this to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them. Remember though, the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach. So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials and opportunity to become financially independent. IT IS UP TO YOU NOW! ++++++++++++++++ MORE TESTIMONIALS ++++++++++++++++ ""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving ""junk mail"". I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I ""knew"" it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old ""I told you so"" on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received total $ 147,200.00....all cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her ""hobby"". Mitchell Wolf, Chicago, Illinois +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ""Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back"". ""I was surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big"". Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ""I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone else......11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the money came within 22 weeks"".

"OWOLABI & ASSOCIATE, FALOMO, IKOYI. LAGOS - NIGERIA. YOUR KIND ATTN., RE: REQUEST FOR MUTUALLY BENEFITTING ENDEAVOUR. I humbly crave your indulgence in sending you this mail, if the contents does not meet with your personal and business ethics, I apologize in advance. I am Barrister Kola Owolabi( attorney at law), I represent Alhaji Ishmaila Ibrahim Gwarzo’s estates. Alhaji Gwarzo was the chief security advicer of the then military leader of this country(Nigeria) in the person of Late General Sani Abacha who died on the 8th of June 1998. With the advent of a new democratic dispensation in the country under the leadership of Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo (Rtd), my client has come under severe persecution due to the sensitive position he held in the last military regime, presently he is under house arrest restricted only to the confines of his village. The main purpose of this mail is to intimate you of a business proposal that might be of interest to you. My client has informed me of the existence of funds deposited with a security company abroad. This fund came about as part of security votes that were allocated to my client's portfolio during his tenure as chief security adviser to the then president. What happened was that he had part of the funds transferred from the vaults of the Central Bank Of Nigeria to this security outfit with the aim of purchasing arms and ammunitions for the personal security outfit of the then president. But before the purchase could take place the president died. My client has decided to keep this for himself as all his properties has been confisticated by the present regime. But due to his incarceration he cannot travel out and effect the change of possession to his benefit. I have been mandated by my client to source for a foreign partner that can help him facilitate the change of possession. The deposit certificate and the code needed for the execution of this endeavor are in my possession. The funds in question is USD17.6M (Seventeen Million, Six Hundred Thousand United States dollars Only). Should this proposition be of interest to you, you can reach me through my e-mail address so that we can go through the rudiments of this endeavor. I remain most obliged. Barrister Kola Owolabi(JP). Principal Partner. Owolabi & Associates __________________________________________________________________ Your favorite stores, helpful shopping tools and great gift ideas.

"Dear Sir, With due respect and humility I write you this letter which I believe you would be of great assistance to my children and I. I got your contact through my husband commercial address book and believed that you must be a trust worthy and reliable person that will not like to intimidate me or betray my trust after hearing this news. I am a native of KONOBO in the KEREMA local district of SIERRA LEONE in West Africa and the wife of Late DR. MUNDI A. KOJO who was assassinated by the rebel forced loyal to Major John Paul Koromah because he was the Director General National Gold and Diamond Mining Corporation of Sierra Leone. Few days before my husband was assassinated, he instructed me and my children (Ibrahim and Amina) to move out of Sierra Leone immediately, before the powerful Economic community of West African States (ECOMOG) forces intervened, which eventually resulted into a brutal civil war. My children and I managed to escape to Togo through the help of my husband's friend. We came into Togo with some valuables including a cash sum of $25MILLION(TWENTY FIVE MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY) in two trunks boxes which I have deposited with a Trust Company here in Togo and special arrangement has been made with the currier company who will freight the money to your country. Meanwhile, I want to leave Togo entirely with this money for investment in your country because of a stable political situation there and mostly for the future of my children. I want you to please assist us to claim this fund from the Trust Company in any of their branches in Europe, after which the fund will be deposited into your account for investment in your country. You should also help us to source for good investment opportunity so that we can invest wisely in your country when the fund is finally confirmed in your account. We have it in mind to reward you handsomely for your assistance as we have resolved to give you 20% of the total sum for your help. But due to how I am being monitored by the Sierra Leonean Government Secret Agents, I will advice you to have the deal concluded with my son (IBRAHIM KOJO). Please contact my son on this email: ibrahimkojo@caramail.com , immediately you receive this letter to enable us proceed in earnest towards retrieving the consignments and transferring same into your account. Your private Fax and Phone is needed in this transaction for private discussions. Note: There is no risk involved in this business. Remain Blessed, MRS. ANNE KOJO",spam

"Dear sir,, My name is DR Steven M Duba , the son of MR. Theo Duba of Zimbabwe. I got your address from South African Information exchange Johannesburg. . Due to the previous war against white farmers in Zimbabwe by PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE and his supporters to claim all the white owned farms in our country, he ordered all the White owned farmers to surrender all their farms to his party members and his followers. My father was a victim of this oppression and inhuman behavior as he was one of the richest farmers in our country,my fayher was totaly against the act by the presidnt MUGABE. The president�s supporters invaded my father�s farm, burnt everything in the farm, arrested him and confiscated all his investment. Early last year when this victimization of white farmers by president Mugabe started, my late father envisaged a worse situation, he arranged almost all his money concealed it in a box and smuggled it out of Zimbabwe through Diplomatic means to South Africa. When he arrived South Africa, he lodged the box in a private security company through the help of his lawyer here in South Africa without revealing the real contents of the box to the security company, then, went back home. He registered the box as family treasure. While he was still in detention that led to his death due to torture, he directed me to his lawyer in South Africa because of the escalation of the crisis in Zimbabwe. He did not want my life to be in danger. He was arrested on the 5th of March last year. Unfortunately my dear father died on the 10th of December 2001.I came to south Africa March,2002. Now my stay here in Africa is frustrating and depressing because my father�s lawyer is presently hospitalized in London due to terrible heart problem; though the lodgment documents are with me, as such I want to relocate to your country for good. Presently, my residence permit here in South Africa is an Asylum permit as a refugee. I am seeking for your assistance in transferring the money in the security company (US$15 Million) out of this country to your country for investment. If you think you can help me, Please try to get in touch with me immediately with the number below . Your compensation/share for assistance will be negotiated if you are ready to assist me. Since the problem in my country is still lingering, please endeavor to keep this information to yourself and secret, because I wouldn�t want anything that will expose me, and the existence of this money. Your urgent response will be highly appreciated. Sincerely yours, STEVEN DUBA (DR). TEL:27-83-713-2696 __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!? Yahoo!

I am sorry this mail Will surprise you, though we do not know, Due to the current war against white farmers in Zimbabwe and the support of President Robert Mugabe to Claim all white owned farms in our country to gain Favor for re-election. All white farmers were asked to Surrender their farms to the government for Re-distribution and infact to his political party Members and my father though black was the treasury of the farmers association and a strong member of an Opposition party that did not support the president Idea.

"Hi - ( http://club.4tfox.com ) You get emails every day, offering to show you how to make money. Most of these emails are from people who are NOT making any money. And they expect you to listen to them? Enough. If you want to make money with your computer, then you should hook up with a group that is actually DOING it. We are making a large, continuing income every month. What's more - we will show YOU how to do the same thing. This business is done completely by internet and email, and you can even join for free to check it out first. If you can send an email, you can do this. No special ""skills"" are required. How much are we making? Anywhere from $2000 to $9000 per month. We are real people, and most of us work at this business part-time. But keep in mind, we do WORK at it - I am not going to insult your intelligence by saying you can sign up, do no work, and rake in the cash. That kind of job does not exist. But if you are willing to put in 10-12 hours per week, this might be just the thing you are looking for. This is not income that is determined by luck, or work that is done FOR you - it is all based on your effort. But, as I said, there are no special skills required. And this income is RESIDUAL - meaning that it continues each month (and it tends to increase each month also). Interested? I invite you to find out more. You can get in as a free member, at no cost, and no obligation to continue if you decide it is not for you. We are just looking for people who still have that ""burning desire"" to find an opportunity that will reward them incredibly well, if they work at it. To grab a FREE ID# and have more information, simply go to the web address http://club.4tfox.com and send me an email with following information ""Send me a free membership!"" Be sure to include your: 1. First name 2. Last name 3. Email address (if different from above) We will confirm your position and send you a special report as soon as possible, and also Your free Member Number. If you are not interested in tring to Earn Money, :) you are interested in the huge discount from the 140 Online Shops, Very Cheap ISP package and many many more, You can also go to the web address: http://club.4tfox.com/#id-GreatService That's all there's to it. We'll then send you info, and you can make up your own mind. Looking forward to hearing from you! Sincerely, Hugh Zou P.S. After having several negative experiences with network marketing companies I had pretty much given up on them. This is different - there is value, integrity, and a REAL opportunity to have your own home-based business... and finally make real money on the internet. Don't pass this up..you can sign up and test-drive the program for FREE. All you need to do is get your free membership.

"I am Mr.IKE EJOH. Bank Manager of Diamond Bank of Nigeria, Lagos Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposal for you. On June 6 1999 a FOREIGN Oil consultant/contractor with the FEDERAL MINISTRY OF AVIATIONMr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his employers, the FEDERAL MINISTRY OF AVIATION that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one willever come forward to claim it.According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 6 (six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, i have just sucided in getting this fund sent to holland through a security company called GLOBAL& BASIC FINANCIAL COMPANY., I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that i will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the owner of this fund in the security company. i shall employ the service of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the changes and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate & administration in your favour. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Bran ch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please replyimmediately via the private email address . Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Awaiting your urgent reply via my email: Thanks and regards. MR.IKE EJOH",spam

"Hi, I'm a college dropout. I work about two hours a day. I'm ambitious, but extremely lazy, and I make over $250,000 a year. Are you curious yet? In a minute I'm going to tell you my secret, it's the dirty little secret of the Internet ... You've probably heard stories about people making whopping huge money online, but you thought they were the big corporate execs, famous programmers, or boy-geniuses. Well, grasshopper, think again ... It's people like you and me that are making the real money. Yep, people like YOU AND ME! Ever since the ""dot com bubble"" burst in 1999, small-time entrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 companies look for bankruptcy lawyers. Today small business owners and ordinary folks like you and me can use the web to achieve complete financial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little work. How? By learning the most profitable marketing technique ever created - it's called BULK EMAIL. If you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then you know what bulk email is. I bet you can't click on DELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right? You might not want their product, but remember that thousands of other folks probably do. Bulk email is a percentage game - every bulker who contacts you makes a six figure income on the Internet. I guarantee it. Now let's go back to Math 101 and review some numbers ... If you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a few dollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one auction. How many people see your ad? Maybe a couple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand over a period of days. Using bulk email, YOU CAN SEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY at virtually no cost. Whether your send 100,000 emails or 100 million emails, the price is the same. ZERO! Stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when hardly anyone sees your ad! Imagine that you have a decent product with a profit margin of $20.00 on each sale. If you send an email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person in a thousand actually places an order, then you just generated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours of work. It's that simple ... All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A THOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH. The best thing is that anyone can do it. Doesn't matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old executive working from an office building in New York City. Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs. All it takes is a few days of study, plenty of ambition, and some basic familiarity with the Internet. I quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the ""Dot Com"" mania, and I've never looked back. I started with no money, no product to sell, and only the most rudimentary computer skills. I saw an opportunity and I seized it. A few years later, I bought my own home - with CASH. You don't need any money. You don't need a product. You don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience whatsoever is required. If you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that you'd jump right on it. It would be a dream come true. So what are you waiting for?! I'm going to ask you four simple questions. If you answer YES to all of them, then I can almost promise that you will make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year. Here goes ... Do you have basic experience with the web? Do you have a computer and an Internet connection? Do you have a few hours each day of free time? Do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards complete financial freedom? If you answer YES to these questions, you could be making $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your home. Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats the 9-5 daily grind! All you need is ambition and commitment. This is no ""get rich quick scheme"". You have to work to make big bucks, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do it. You're probably wondering if it's hard to get started. Don't worry, it's not! I will show you step-by-step how to start your first email campaign and how to build a booming online business. You'll be generating orders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less than seven days. Okay, so what if you don't have anything to sell? No problem!! I'll show you where to find hot products that sell like CRAAAAAAZY! Most people delay starting an Internet business because they have nothing to sell, but I'm removing that hurdle right now. After reading the Bulkbook, you can build your complete product line in less than two hours! There is NO EXCUSE not to get started! I will get you up-and-running within seven days. In fact ... I personally guarantee that you will start your own bulk email campaign less than a week after reading the Bulkbook! I'll give you a toll-free phone number to reach me 24 hours a day, seven days a week; where else will you find that level of service?! I will also include a step-by-step guide to starting your very first email campaign called ""Seven Days to Bulk Email Success"". This seperate guide contains a daily routine for you to follow with specific, exact instructions on how to get started. On day one, for example, I teach you where to find a product to sell. The next day you learn how to build a fresh mailing list. On the seventh day, you just click send! Your very first campaign is ready to go. As a special bonus, you'll recieve a FREE copy of our STEALTH MASS MAILER, a very powerful bulk email program which retails for $49.99! I'll even include 7 million email addresses absolutely FREE if you order NOW! Stop wasting your money on auction listing fees, classifieds, and banner ads - they don't work, and never will! If you are SERIOUS about making money on the Internet, bulk email is your only option. What are you waiting for? Few of us are willing to share this knowledge, but I promise to teach you everything I know about bulk emailing in this extraordinary bulk emailer's handbook ... The Bulkbook! Once again, here's the deal. You give me $29.99. I give you ALL THE TOOLS YOU NEED to become a successful, high profit bulk emailer.

"================This Is Definitely the Answer We All Have Been Waiting For=============== Every once in awhile, something comes along that you just know, from the people involved, from the features, or just from gut-feeling, that it's going to be very special, something with huge potential and hope. When you know it, it rests deep in your bones, and it's hard not to get overly excited and scream it to the world, which is why I'm writing you today. Although this program is launching with all the potential of being as big as anything on the Internet, and you will soon see it advertised and promoted everywhere you go, I would like to give you an opportunity to get in early before the masses. Traditionally, there have been a couple of flaws to any MLM (multi-level marketing for you newcomers) that have made it difficult for programs to last after the initial hoopla. Today, we have launched the solution to those problems, the newest and most innovative system ever to hit Multi-level Marketing. With a new software system and an ingenious payplan, combined with a 100% payout, everyone comes out a winner. The truth is, you've got to see it to believe it, so rather than feed you a lot of hype and tell you this is the miracle you've been looking for, the magic link that will end all your problems, or a lot of other things you don't need to hear, I'm just going to make you a very simple offer. Email me with 'Send Link' in the subject line to: itshappening@mail2world.com and I will provide the link so you can take a test drive, absolutely risk-free. You can get a birds-eye inside look, revealing the inner-workings of this revolutionary new discovery in online income opportunities. Should you decide you like what you see, you will have the option of activating your position, but that is completely at your option. This isn't a trick, I'm just so convinced that this is such a sound program and unique but solid opportunity that I don't want you to miss out on the chance to get an early position. With an explosive launch, positions will be filling up rapidly, and you have before you a chance to explore the program before diving in head first. If you're one of those cautious people (and who isn't these days on the Internet), that likes to ""look before you leap"" then here is your chance. Thank you for your time, and I hope you discover why we're all smiling!! Please do not treat this message as spam. I am a professional and very successful networker with a data base of 100,000. I was pursueded to purchase this list containing 200,000 names of individuals, which is guaranteed to include only those people who have given their consent to receive information. I have not used this means of marketing before and frankly I am dubious about its validity. However, having spent an arm and a leg purchasing it I'm initially sending this message to just a small number of the email address's (2,000) to guage results. If you want more information I will happily supply the link without any obligation. But if its of no interest or you take exception to receiving this mail then please accept my apologies for the intrusion and delete the message immediately. As this is a one time mailing there is no need to respond with 'remove'. Thank you.",spam

"Dear friend, I am Mrs. Sese-seko widow of late President Mobutu Sese-seko of Zaire, now known as Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). I am moved to write you this letter. This was in confidence considering my present circumstance and situation. I escaped along with my husband and two of our sons James Kongolo and Nzanga out of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to Abidjan, Coted'ivoire where my family and I settled, while we later moved to settled in Morroco where my husband later died of cancer disease. However, due to this situation we decided to change most of my husband's billions of dollars deposited in Swiss bank and other countries into other forms of money coded for safe purpose because the new head of state of (Dr) Mr Laurent Kabila has made arrangement with the Swiss government and other European countries to freeze all my late husband's treasures deposited in some european countries. Hence, my children and I decided laying low in Africa to study the situation till when things gets better. Like now that president Kabila is dead and the son taking over (Joseph Kabila). One of my late husband's chateaux in Southern France was confiscated by the french government, and as such I had to change my identity so that my investment will not be traced and confiscated.I have deposited the sum Eighteen Million United State Dollars (US$18,000,000,00.) With a security company for safe keeping. What I want you to do is to indicate yourinterest that you can assist us in receiving the money on our behalf, so that I can introduce you to my son (Kongolo) who has the out modalities for the claim of the said funds. I want you to assist in investing this money, but I will not want my identity revealed.I will also want to acquire real/landed properties and stock in multi-national companies and to engage in other safe and non-speculative investments as adviseby your good self. May I at this point emphasize the high level of confidentiality, which this upcoming project demands,and hope you will not betray the trust and confidence, which I repose in you.In conclusion, if you want to assist us, my son (Kongolo) shall divulgeto you all briefs regarding this project, tell you where the funds are currently being maintained and also discuss remuneration for your services.For this reason kindly furnish us your contact information,that is your personal telephone and fax number for validation purpose and acknowledge receipt of this mail using the above email address.

"Mr.Vincent Nnaji, Standard Trust Bank Ltd, Lagos,Nigeria. Dear Sir, I am Mr.Vincent Nnaji, Bank Manager of Standard Trust Bank,Lagos,Nigeria. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On January 6,1998 a Foreign Oil Consultant Foreign contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Mr. James Herbert made a numbered time Fixed Deposit for twelve calendar months valued at US$20M ( Twenty Million United States Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. James Herbert died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.James Herbert did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$20M has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for safe-keeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law at the expiration of 5 years the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money I deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes though the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as I tagged them to be photographic materials for export I am writing you because I as a public servant I cannot operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than $1m. I want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. All these are to make sure that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the owner of the boxes. The money will be shared in the ratio of 70% for me and 25% for you and 5% will take care of all expenses. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantee the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my private email address. Upon your response I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe with utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Awaiting your urgent reply via my private email to indicate your interest. Thanks and Regards, MR.VINCENT NNAJI.",spam

"My name is Jeremy Lessaris. I'm looking for investment properties in the Midwest. The issue I've been having is that not every everyone deals with the properties I'm looking for. You know the houses that you are almost sure will not sell; maybe they're really ugly or need a lot of work or are in a bad neighborhood. But for what ever reason, the houses just don't sell. I need those houses... Most of the agents I've dealt with were hesitant because there isn't much of a return for what time and effort you invest. However, the private investors I work with use ""unconventional"" private funding so we both can avoid long drawn out loan approvals. In fact most cases we just pay cash and close in a week. I am pre-qualified with Greentree Funding for up to $900,000 for a purchase money mortgage based on a non-owner occupied loan at 90% LTV. (And of course you get your full commission.) I'm not a licensed real estate agent nor am I affiliated with any real estate firm, which means I can work with you just about any way you want. Please don't be under the impression that we have to pay under market value to be interested. Sometimes I can even pay retail price. The only guarantee I'll make is that I will not waste your time, and in most cases I can tell you over the phone whether I'm interested or not. If you are looking to purchace a project home from our inventory or would like information on forming an alliance with Synteligent Properties, please contact me @ 847.366.4300 or email me @ jeremy@synteligent.com Best Wishes, Jeremy Lessaris 847.366.4300 www.synteligent.com jeremy@synteligent.com To Unsubscribe: send mail to majordomo@FreeBSD.org with ""unsubscribe freebsd-ports"" in the body of the message",spam

"BASSEY& ASSOCIATES FALOMO, IKOYI. LAGOS - NIGERIA. FOR YOUR KIND ATTENTION, RE: REQUEST FOR MUTUALLY BENEFITTING ENDEAVOUR. I humbly crave your indulgence in sending you this mail, if the contents does not meet with your personal and business ethics, I apologize in advance. I am Barrister Williams Bassey ( attorney at law), I represent Alhaji Ishmaila Ibrahim Gwarzo's estates. Alhaji Gwarzo was the chief security advicer of the then military leader of this country(Nigeria) in the person of Late General Sani Abacha who died on the 8th of June 1998. With the advent of a new democratic dispensation in the country under the leadership of Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo (Rtd), my client has come under severe persecution due to the sensitive position he held in the last military regime, presently he is under house arrest restricted only to the confines of his village. The main purpose of this mail is to intimate you of a business proposal that might be of interest to you. My client has informed me of the existence of funds deposited with a security company abroad. This fund came about as part of security votes that were allocated to my client's portfolio during his tenure as chief security advicer to the then president. What happened was that he had part of the funds transferred from the vaults of the Central Bank Of Nigeria to this security outfit with the aim of purchasing arms and ammunitions for the personal security outfit of the then president. But before the purchase could take place the president died. My client has deceided to keep this for himself as all his properties has been confisticated by the present regime. But due to his incarceration he cannot travel out and effect the change of possession to his benefit. I have been mandated by my client to source for a foreign partner that can help him facilitate the change of possession. The deposit certificate and the code needed for the execution of this endeavour are in my possession. The funds in question is USD33.6M (Thirty-Three Million, Six Hundred Thousand United States dollars Only). Should this proposition be of interest to you,you can reach me through my e-mail address so that we can go through the rudiments of this endeavour. I remain most obliged.

"It was the Spring of 1979. I was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school with buck-teeth and freckles. Each day in the cafeteria, I walked from table to table ... Stealing other kids' lunch money. No, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made them a little deal. ""Let me borrow two dollars today,"" I said, ""and I'll bring you five dollars next week."" The investment was too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes. Of course when ""next week"" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash, I promised to pay them even more the week after that, if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit longer. Eventually the end of the year came and went, high school started and with it came girls, and homework, and parties, and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more things on their mind than last year's lunch money. I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid, and I didn't even get beat up. Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market secrets you will ever learn. First of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're not going to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when you're ahead. Don't wait for the boat to sink before grabbing the lifejacket. Second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind. They are looking out for their own money, not yours. The ""professionals"", those stuffy investment counselors and money managers, will always tell you that the best time to buy is NOW. According to those guys, the longer you keep your money in the market, the more money you're going to make. Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is ""NEVER"". In a sense, they are right. If you put $250,000 in an index fund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollars in thirty or forty years. But here's the problem: Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich? Hell no! You want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard to make use of your fortune when you're seventy years old in a wheelchair. If you could make a million dollars in the next few years, what would you do with it? Where would you travel? What kind of car would you buy? The fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich. If your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility is your ally, and stability your enemy. You want to see those large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed by the four hundred point crash a week later. You don't care if the market went up or down 20% this year as long it was UNSTABLE. That's how you're going to make the money. What I'm talking about here is day trading. My father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks and he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years he makes money. The day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a $25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade. He acts quickly, taking advantage of all the information at his disposal about a certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or down within hours, sometimes within minutes. I can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing amounts of money at it. It's not rocket science, and you only need to learn a few basic principles to get started. Society would have you believe that successful trading is complicated and requires formal training. The truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment strategies to make money. Popular media and investment professionals portray successful trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing ring. They don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell don't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm to execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty dollars. They make their money only if you believe two lies: 1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average person. 2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks per trade. Here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely, positively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ... The strategies for profitable day trading are in fact so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend a few hours of studying. After reading over 200 financial books and publications during the past decade, and after using day trading to successfully make more than four million dollars in the stock market, I've learned the following lessons: ** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple. ** Anyone can do it. ** It only takes a few hours to learn. When I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn't become wealthy overnight. If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. Buy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through hard work, knowledge, and determination. After learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks brought modest gains. The next few months gave me the practical experience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling close to a six figure income. In less than three years with no formal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk, I had made my first million. The knowledge that I gained during those formative trading years I am willing to share with you in my new book, the Master Trader. You will learn from my mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple, secret formula for day trading that I've used profitably year after year. The income of the day trader can be staggering. Thousands, even hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within minutes. The difference between making money and losing your shirt is simply this: knowledge. I will provide that knowledge, and I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. Average Income of a Day Trader: 5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year 22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year 35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. 27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year 11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year After reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely profitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you win DESPITE the current market weakness. Here is just a snippet of what I will teach you: *** Make money whether a stock goes up or down. *** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds. *** Learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to buy them and the exact price to sell them. *** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the mistakes beginners make. *** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money consistently in every market! *** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance for great success. *** Profit on huge intraday price swings. *** Make money on the biggest news stories. *** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum returns. *** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street professionals use. *** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind. It's time to ask yourself: ""Am I going to listen to the Professionals who say BUY BUY BUY but never sell? Or am I going to take control of my own financial future, and start making money RIGHT NOW in the stock market?"" Who is looking out for your best economic interests - some wealthy Wall Street stockbroker, or yourself? With the Master Trader e-book, you will learn everything you need to know in order to get started with Day Trading ... from choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional trading strategies that make professional traders millions of dollars. The Master Trader e-book is the most comprehensive yet easy to understand and straight-forward book ever written about active trading. If you are serious about success in short term stock trading - ORDER TODAY and start paving the road to your own financial future. Oh, and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade? His high school friends laughed when he said he was going to make money in the stock market. Six years later, he bought a beach-front home on the California coast - WITH CASH. Oops, they weren't laughing anymore. In a rollercoaster market like we have today, day trading is the fastest track to wealth. If you're looking for a long-term retirement investment with no risk that goes up 5% a year, then by all means, this ain't your kind of game. But if you want the QUICKEST possible way to make a FORTUNE in the market, with the lowest element of risk, then order the MASTER TRADER e-book right now. I promise to teach you ALL of the secrets that helped me become a millionaire through successful day trading.

"Welcome to ""Ghetto"" America! �...Yes, you heard me; I said ""Ghetto"" America! What is ""Ghetto"" America, I'm glad you asked. Before I go on please be warned, this explanation may not sit well with many of you, however it is no less true! ""Ghetto"" America is a society of individuals comprised primarily of African Americans who represent the impoverished, and often unpolished side of ""Black America;"" Confused?! I shall explain further; have you ever passed by a typical ghetto community; namely the ""projects"" and noticed an unusual amount of fancy cars parked throughout that particular neighborhood, and wondered how could that be? Or maybe you have been to a shopping mall, and noticed an unusual amount of young ""teen looking"" black women carrying infants, or pushing baby carriages and often with a toddler in tow! Perhaps you also noticed that there was rarely any male companion accompanying them. If you paid close attention you might have also noticed the absence of the all important ""wedding band"" missing from their respective ring fingers!"" .And of course we have all heard stories of young black men carrying guns, and knives, allegedly mugging, robbing and carjacking people of all sorts! Did you know that many young African American women refuse to date African American males if they do not own or possess an automobile. In fact many young Black women prefer only to date individuals who represent the subversive side of society; commonly known as ""Thugs"" or ""Street Hustlers;"" Also, did you know that many young African American males prefer to buy expensive luxury cars while living in government housing better known as the ""projects"" rather than move away, purchase new homes, save, or even make investments? ""Attention"" This is Not another ""Boyz in the Hood"" Story! These newly distinguished ""Black Generation Xers"" are suffering through utter chaos. ""Baby Makers, Loser choosers, Welfare Abusers...Images of My America"" is a collection of observations, and commentary as told through the eyes of a young African American Male who experienced, and perpetuated many of the truths that many in ""Black America,"" and the world in general would have you believe do not exist. It is a riveting expose that sheds light on the oppressive, and often discriminatory nature of ""Mainstream American Society."" A society that has nurtured the rampant disregards for self-respect, and enlightenment that many young African American men, and women currently suffer from. The writer supports his arguments with direct references to the overwhelming numbers of young black single mothers attempting to raise children, with many being teens themselves; and the foolish criteria that is utilized when choosing their mates; oftentimes being based on nothing more than the young black male's tough or cool neighborhood reputation. The author also identifies the self-destructive and often criminal behavior that many young black men perpetuate on a daily basis like, refusing to pursue higher education, carrying guns, robbing, stealing, selling drugs, driving fancy cars, and wearing expensive jewelry. The negative and self-debasing behavior committed by both males, and females is due in large part to a lack of guidance resulting from having been reared in fatherless homes. These poor choices, and behavioral disorders coupled with the unnecessary burden that it places on tax paying citizens in the form of welfare abuse, and over crowded prison populations are the center causes for the cycle of rampant poverty, and lack of direction that currently exists in young ""Black America"" today.

"A great sponsor will not make you money. A great product line will not make you money either. A great compensation plan will not make you money either. A great company will not make you money either. Some say it's a combination of the above. Some say it's what's inside you that matters the most. Forget about meetings, one-on-one, 3-ways calls, etc. Those old ways of network marketing has come and gone. They wear you out long before you make any money. What makes you money is a downline associated with a stable company that has consumable products. Where's the downline coming from? Well, we have an online automatic recruiting system that does the work for you. Our system will place paying members in your downline.

"ATTN: I am Edward Mulete JR. the son of Mr. STEVE MBEKI MULETE from Zimbabwe. I am sorry this mail Will surprise you, though we do not know, my mother Mrs. Clara Got your contact through her private search. Due to the current war against white farmers in Zimbabwe and the support of President Robert Mugabe to Claim all white owned farms in our country to gain Favor for re-election. All white farmers were asked to Surrender their farms to the government for Re-distribution and infact to his political party Members and my father though black was the treasury of the farmers association and a strong member of an Opposition party that did not support the president Idea. He then ordered his party members and the police Under his pay row to invade my father's farm and burn Down everything in the farm. They killed my Father and took away a lot of items from his farm. After the death of my father, our local pastor and a Close friend of my father handed us over will Documents with instructions from my father that we Should leave Zimbabwe incase anything happen to him. The will Documents has a certificate of deposit, confirming a deposit Kept in custody for us in a security company unknown To the company that the content is money hence it was deposited as Personal belongings and ensure that we do not remain here as we could Easily be found by his enemies. The total amount is US$21.5M.We are therefore soliciting for Your assistance to help us move the fund out of Zimbabwe, as our fate and future is far from reality, hence this mail to you. The president's present ban of International Press into Zimbabwe and the drop from office of the Finance Minister to avoid giving white farmers fund Transfer Clearance above US$1M is just a few of the Unthinkable things he is committing in my Country. I have tried to reach my father's close friend Mr. John Casahans from Australia also a farmer who was Leaving in Zimbabwe with us but left with his family Late last year following this ugly development to no Avail. Should you be interested to help us, contact me Immediately via email for easy communication and I Will furnish you with the time frame and modalities of the transaction. We have concluded a wonderful plan of Caring out the transfer within two weeks. Please note that This transaction is100% confidential and risk free and will Not endanger you or us in any way. We have resolved to give you 20% Of the total sum upon confirmation of the fund in any Account of your choice were the incident of taxation will not take much tool on the money and we look Forward to coming over to your country to invest our Share and settle there. I will a private Phone so that our conversation can be 100% confidential. Please do not use the reply button, reply only to Edmulete7@netscape.net Please take note.

"HELLO...By reading the short Summary just below, you will see how you can learn new skills in communication, do a direct marketing program on the internet, and at the same time, earn $100,000 or more to enable you to CHANGE YOUR LIFE!!! ************SUMMARY*************************** Just read this Summary, follow the actions that it advises, and start earning some serious money. You will learn new skills in communications and how to market on the internet. What a Deal! Your total cash investment is just $50.00. Step 1. If this is the first time you have seen this message, and you have not joined in this program before, then take out five US$10.00 bills (total $50 investment), and mail out $10.00 each to the following people to purchase five Guides on communications. For each Guide that you will be ordering and buying, write out on a sheet of plain white paper, your own name, address, and YOUR OWN EMAIL ADDRESS, and the number and name of the Guide that you are buying. Then fold the paper, put the $10.00 bill inside the sheet of paper, insert the paper and $10.00 bill into an envelope, address the envelope with the name and address of the person whose name is shown under each Guide below, and mail the envelope by first class or air mail. Be sure to put enough postage stamps on the envelopes. No need to send by registered mail. LIST OF FIVE NAMES**************************** ________________________________________________ GUIDE# 1: ""How to be A More Effective Public Speaker"" Order Guide #1 for US$10.00 CASH from: (In addition to Guide #1, you will receive a valuable marketing Guide ""A Million Bucks From the Internet"", free of charge) Derrick Nguyen 9530 Whitmore St El Monte, CA 91733 USA ________________________________________________ GUIDE # 2: ""How to Give a Business Presentation"" Order Guide # 2 for US$10.00 CASH from: Tim Fai GPO Box 260 Macau (via Hong Kong) ________________________________________________ GUIDE# 3: ""How to Write More Effectively"" Order Guide # 3 for US$10.00 CASH from: Luis Pastor Apartado 81 48080 Bilbao Spain ________________________________________________ GUIDE # 4: ""What to do at a Social Function"" Order Guide # 4 for US$10.00 CASH from: Chester Waldvogel 11 Chestnut Way Berlin, MD 21811 USA ________________________________________________ GUIDE # 5: ""How To Sharpen Your Mind"" Order Guide # 5 for US$10.00 CASH from: J. Siden Krondikesvagen 54 A 83147 Ostersund Sweden ________________________________________________ END OF LIST OF FIVE NAMES********************* Step 2. These Guides will be emailed to you. Save these Guides on your computer's hard disk as other people will be ordering these Guides from you, paying you for them and you will need to email the Guides to the new buyers. Step 3. From the list of names above, delete the name and address of the person shown under GUIDE#5, and replace that slot with the name and address of the person from GUIDE #4's slot. Be sure to copy the name and address exactly as shown. Check the address again. Step 4. Delete name and address under GUIDE #4, and replace with the name and address from GUIDE #3's slot. Step 5. Delete name and address under GUIDE #3, and replace with the name and address from GUIDE#2's slot. Step 6. Delete name and address under GUIDE #2, and replace with the name and address from GUIDE #1's slot. Step 7. Delete name and address under GUIDE #1, and replace with YOUR OWN NAME AND ADDRESS. This step is how your own name and address is entered into the list of names to receive orders for the Guides. Eventually, your own name will go down the list of names until you have reached GUIDE #5, and then be dropped from the list. The key point is that the number of people ordering Guides from you will grow larger the lower down the list your name goes. Step 8. Once you have completed this new list, send out this new email (which shows your name under GUIDE #1) to as many email addresses as possible, as many as 100,000 emails or even more. The greater the number of mailings you make, potentially the greater the number of people who will order the GUIDE #1 from you. These people will then make new emails to send out to their addresses with the email showing your name under GUIDE #2, and so on. This is all you need to do. If you wish to read the rest of this email message, then do so. If not, just do the 8 steps shown above. Remember, the key point is to send out as many emails as possible in step 8, and to encourage and help those who purchase the Guides from you to send out emails of their own. Do NOT change anything other than what is instructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you. Your immediate reaction might be: Why not replace all the names on the list with the names of your spouse, kids, relatives, and friends. That might seem to you like a clever move because new buyers will be sending their money to these people. But that move is the exact opposite of what is to your benefit. What will benefit you most is having people who will send out emails, seek new buyers, and provide assistance to new buyers. If the people you slip into that list aren't going to be sending new emails, you're only hurting yourself by effectively closing down the program with your name on top of the list of the names that you have inserted. There wouldn't be new buyers coming in. So, your sly maneuver will gain you exactly zero! Furthermore, if you have done the work, and your name has worked its way to further down the list, by then you deserve the rewards and earnings from that effort, and it would be unethical for anyone to remove your name for whatever reason. Don't do it to others. Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! You may have a concern that after sending the total $50 to the five people on the list that one of the people will just take your money, and not send you the Guide. Well, rest assured. As we said above, it's to our benefit to have you as a satisfied buyer who will actively send out emails to find new buyers. So don't think the people on the list will try to cheat you or to ""stiff"" you for $10.00. The people on the list would rather have you working hard because your effort will benefit them as well as you. Later on, when other buyers send you the order to buy the Guides, fulfill your end of the deal by sending the ordered Guide to the buyer. Don't cheat. Provide efficient and honest service and we will all benefit. ******END OF SUMMARY************************ =======REST OF MESSAGE====================== With easy-to-use email tools and opt-in email, success in this business is now well within the capabilities of ordinary people who may not have done any internet marketing before. And the earnings potential is staggering! READ THIS EMAIL TO THE END! - follow what it says - and you will not worry whether a RECESSION is coming or not, or whether or not you can afford to buy that new car or home that you have been looking for. Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never responded to one of these before either. One day though, something made me feel: ""You use $50 going to a movie for 2 hours with your spouse, friend, or child, plus a simple meat at a restaurant. Why the heck not?"" No matter where you believe those ""feelings"" came from, I thank every day that feeling came over me. I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be doing had I not. Read on. It works. And when you read the Guides, Youll learn how to become a more effective communicator. What can be better? A way to improve your self-image and confidence and at the same time have the potential to recover your investment and make some good money: making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home. If you work on this program, you will learn a lot about direct marketing on the internet. If you believe direct marketing via the internet is the way sales and marketing will be done in the future, then the experience you will gain here could be a real boost in your work career, possibly even providing a new career for you. = PRINT THIS MESSAGE FOR FUTURE REFERENCE = If you want to make serious money, read this message until you understand it completely and feel confident to follow through on what it advises. FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION ABOVE AND YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS CAN COME TRUE! Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter it, it will NOT work! This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a product for sale to a buyer. Treat it as such and you can see money coming to you in a reasonable period of time, depending on the collective efforts of yourself and the others on the list of five. =========================================== *** Take this entire email, with the modified list of names, and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. There are 2 methods to get this venture going: METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK EMAIL LEGALLY =========================================== Let's say that you start small, to see how it goes, and that you and those involved send out only 5,000 emails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receives only a 0.1% (1/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better but let's just say it is only 0.1%). Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of emails instead of only 5,000 each. Out of your 5,000 emails and a 0.1% response, that is only 5 orders for Guide # 1. Those 5 people who responded also send out 5,000 emails each for a total of 25,000. Out of those 25,000 emails only 0.1% responded with orders. That's 25 people who responded and ordered Guide # 2. Those 25 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 125,000 emails. The 0.1% response to that is 125 orders for Guide # 3. Those 125 people send 5,000 emails each for a total of 625,000 emails sent out. The 0.1% response is 625 orders for Guide # 4. Those 625 people send out 5,000 emails each for a total of 3,125,000 emails. The 0.1% response to that is 3,125 orders for Guide # 5, or $31,250 at $10 per Guide. This may seem a small amount to you, but remember we used a very low response rate with a small number of emails being sent out. See what happens if you can get the response rate up just slightly. If Response Rate is 0.1%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is: $50+250+1,250+6,250+31,250 = $39,050 (as above) If Response Rate is 0.15%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is: $75+560+4,220+31,640+237,300 = $273,795 If Response Rate is 0.2%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is: $100+1,000+10,000+100,000+1,000,000 = $1,111,100 Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 emails each or more? From the example above, you can see the power of leveraging, that is, how much greater is the amount of money from a small increase in the response rate. There are over 200 million people on the internet worldwide and counting, with thousands more coming online every day. METHOD # 2: PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET =========================================== Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there are Many FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will get a response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $10 you receive, all you must do is email the Guide the buyer ordered. Always provide same day service. The people you buy these Guides from will assist and advise you how to get the large number of email addresses that you need to send the new email containing your name and address. In return, when others buy the Guides from you, you also should help those buyers to resell the Guides to their email addresses. This will benefit you because your name would be further down the list, and their new buyers will buy from you. This is no different than ""customer service"" in the retail or the ""bricks and mortars"" business. ===========AVAILABLE GUIDES ============== The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is illegal or somehow ""wrong"". It is simply about time. Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you. ORDER EACH GUIDE BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Always send a single $10 bill (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Guide. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is hidden by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Guide you are ordering, YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address. Be sure to address the envelope correctly and put the proper amount of stamps to mail the envelope. PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE GUIDES NOW FROM THE NAME AND ADDRESS LIST SHOWN AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS EMAIL ________________________________________________ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES === If you do not receive at least 10 orders for GUIDE #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending emails until you do. === Two to three weeks after you receive 10 orders, you should receive 100 orders or more for GUIDE #2. If not, continue advertising or sending emails until you do. Once you have received 100 or more orders for GUIDE # 2, YOU CAN SEE THE PROGRAM IS WORKING, and cash should continue coming in! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Continue to assist new buyers with advice and instruction on how to send out more emails. You can KEEP TRACK of progress by noting which guides people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF EMAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate !!! =========================================== A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: You have just received information that can give you financial freedom to really change your life, but I don't wish to kid you: This requires A BIT OF EFFORT. You can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined. Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Remember to email the revised copy of this email after you have put your name and address in GUIDE#1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 slots as instructed above. One of the people you send this to may send out 100,000 or more emails and your name will be on every one of them. Remember, the more you send out the more potential buyers you will reach. IT IS UP TO YOU! ORDER THE GUIDES NOW AND EMBARK ON THE ROAD TO FINANCIAL SECURITY! Upon your purchase of any GUIDE #1 through #5, the Copyright owner assigns to you two important rights: (1) The right to resell and to distribute via the internet the GUIDE that you have purchased, and (2) the right to assign to your buyer of the GUIDE, the further right for your buyer to resell that GUIDE. Included in your purchase of Guide #1 is a valuable report on how to market on the Internet. It's free of charge and will give you the tools you need. The right to print any of the material contained in the GUIDES is reserved exclusively for the copyright owner. Your right to resell and to distribute copies of the GUIDE applies only to the internet and/or world wide web via electronic distribution. YOU MAY NOT PRINT OUT THE GUIDES TO SELL OR DISTRIBUTE IN ANY WAY. You may print a copy of the Guides for your own personal use to enhance your communication skills. =========================================== * This message is not intended for residents of localities that have legal ordinances prohibiting engaging in such programs.

June 4, 1999- Sirs: The following text was located on a site written or placed by you or under your control: ""DOM is located on Karitane Island and now includes the Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the South Pacific 1000 miles south of Tahiti. However, the Marshall Islands government has condemned the ""fraudulent assertions"" of two organizations, namely the DOM and sister nation, the Kingdom of EnenKio (the Marshallese name for Wake Island), claiming to represent the mid-Pacific nation amid an alleged investment scam according to an article in Agence France- Presse. The Marshall Islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of either nation."" ""A Honolulu-based attorney created the ""Kingdom of EnenKio"" in the early 1990s. It was based on a power of attorney agreement with Marshall Islands paramount chief Mursel Hermios, which granted the attorney broad powers to act on his behalf. The Marshall Islands High Court has ruled the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified, which the ""kingdom"" has disputed."" http://www.goldhaven.com/issue4/Two.htm (disconnected as of 2/1/00) The purpose of this letter is lodge a formal request for correction of false and misleading statements made by the author regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio. While I am pleased to find you have apparently taken a serious interest in the Kingdom of EnenKio, I am aghast at how distorted, erroneous and misleading the article is. As a consequence of my service to His Majesty King Remios and the people of EnenKio, I am obligated to respond to incidents such as this. I will respectfully offer the following line by line correction. For your convenience, your text will be set off (with ""**"") in color: **DOM is located on Karitane Island and now includes the Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the South Pacific 1000 miles south of Tahiti.** (Comment: The construction of this statement implies the Marshall Islands are in the South Pacific Ocean 1000 miles south of Tahiti, in which case a reader may be misled.) Correction: DOM is located on Karitane Island in the South Pacific, 1000 miles south of Tahiti, and now includes Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the North Pacific. **However, the Marshall Islands government has condemned the ""fraudulent assertions"" of two organizations, ...** (Comment: Just because the RMI government ""...has condemned the 'fraudulent assertions' ...of ...EnenKio..."", does that make it true? Why would you want to quote anything from a government that has been internationally criticized [and documented] time and again for fraud, abuse of human rights, outright theft and is in default on almost every financial obligation it has ever made? What purpose do you propose to serve by attacking a concerned group of dedicated people fighting for the very lives of Marshallese natives who have been overrun by foreign invaders, bathed in radiation from nuclear fallout and abused by their own corrupt government?) **...namely the DOM and sister nation, the Kingdom of EnenKio (the Marshallese name for Wake Island),...** (Comment: Nothing could be further from the truth. we cannot speak for DOM, but as for the Kingdom, we don't even know what being a ""sister nation"" means and for you to make this categorically false statement is not only a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of EnenKio, it is a deceptive intrusion upon the sovereign, His Majesty King Remios, the sovereign of EnenKio and Eneen-Kio Atoll, and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of journalism. Doesn't anybody check sources anymore?) Correction: The Kingdom of EnenKio is an independent sovereign state and the same could be said for DOM. **...claiming to represent the mid-Pacific nation amid an alleged investment scam according to an article in Agence France- Presse.** (Comment: The government of the Kingdom of EnenKio represents the people of EnenKio, who are forced to live in exile from Eneen-Kio Atoll, lands and seas that played a significant role in Marshallese culture for perhaps 2000 years. Furthermore, ""...an article in Agence France-Presse"" has no merit as it was authored by a source in the Marshall Islands government. My preceding comments apply. The Kingdom of EnenKio is not now and never has been engaged in an ""...investment scam..."". We have tried for many years to attract qualified investors and funding sources for programs that will not only benefit the people of EnenKio, but also will positively impact people around the globe. In fact, we are currently working with a former NASA Astronaut. One tool scammers have in their arsenal is to discredit visionary programs of legitimate entities so they can feed on carcasses of the ignorant. Many journalists use the same technique to sell their stories on sensationalism. Doesn't anybody check sources anymore?) **The Marshall Islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of either nation.** (Comment: The Kingdom of EnenKio has made no ""fraudulent claims"" of which I am aware, and in my post, I am responsible for all published information. I would personally caution any ""..countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of..."" nations, companies or publications if I had credible proof to that effect. However, my preceding comments apply as to credibility of any RMI ministry source. Furthermore, the RMI has repeatedly attacked the credibility of His Majesty King Hermios, who happens to be the ancestral sovereign owner under Marshallese custom of over 1/3 of the land in the Marshall Islands, including recent attempts to sequester him against his will. We believe some officials in the RMI are afraid of what will happen to them if honesty and integrity returns to the administration of lands and programs to assist the people with their pressing needs and they no longer have their hands on the till. To perpetrate their jaundiced agenda is an irresponsible abuse of journalism.) **A Honolulu-based attorney created the ""Kingdom of EnenKio"" in the early 1990s.** (Comment: Mr. Moore is not an Attorney, though he was living in Honolulu in the early 1990s.) Correction: The Kingdom of EnenKio was established by decree of the owner of Eneen-Kio Atoll [a.k.a. Enen-kio, Halcyon, Disclerta, Wake and 6-8 other names], Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios, who then was Paramount Chief of the Northern Ratak atolls [he passed away in December 1998] and was fully recognized by the RMI government. He declared the sovereign state of EnenKio in 1994, whereupon the people chose him as their King over Eneen-Kio Atoll, ratified the Constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy. **It was based on a power of attorney agreement with Marshall Islands paramount chief Mursel (sic) Hermios, which granted the attorney broad powers to act on his behalf.** Correction: The establishment of the Kingdom of EnenKio was made possible by Murjel's appointment of Mr. Robert Moore, the adopted brother of Hermios, Alab of Taongi Atoll and a private citizen, to the post of Minister Plenipotentiary. The document of appointment was also a Special Power of Attorney which granted Mr. Moore very specific instructions to do whatever was possible to expel the United States from Eneen-Kio Atoll and establish an independent state on Hermios' and the people's behalf. **The Marshall Islands High Court has ruled the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified, which the ""kingdom"" has disputed.** (Comment: Since when is a Special Power of Attorney an ""agreement""? The Marshall Islands High Court has no record or knowledge of the Special Power of Attorney, except as has been publicized by the Kingdom of EnenKio, and certainly exercises no jurisdiction over Eneen-Kio Atoll, which lies over 100 miles north of lawful RMI boundaries. The RMI has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll because the atoll, by any name you choose, was not incorporated into the RMI when it formed its government in 1979, nor was it subsequently incorporated by any act, law, mandate or otherwise of any present or former Iroijlaplap or Monarch of Eneen-Kio and any statement to the contrary is false, fraudulent and irresponsible.) Finally, I suggest you, as a journalist or publisher, do a little more research, not only into establishment and development of the Kingdom of EnenKio, but into the prehistoric history and more recent U.S. invasion of Eneen-Kio Atoll, properly named by 'Marshallese' centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries. Then I invite you to our Embassy in Honolulu to review the public files and documents mentioned above, all of which exist in hard copy (not in 'cyberspace') and most of which are referenced or published at our official web site. Be sure to view the documents at our Resource Center which show, in many cases, full-color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so states in the world, many of which are first world. In closing, I would simply appeal to your presumed sense of morality and ethics and request the referenced article be amended or corrected and , if corrected elsewhere, that a link be provided to the relevant paragraph cited above in the article. SKIP TO NEXT FILE �TOP OF PAGE June 3, 1999- Sir: The following report was sent to me in which the author mentions the Kingdom of EnenKio (thank you for spelling 'EnenKio' correctly. The purpose of this letter below is to lodge a formal request for correction of false and misleading statements made by the author regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio. ""Fantasy Island"" -- ""Melchizedek passport scam reveals how the Internet can take fraud to new frontiers"" By Bertil Lintner in Bangkok, December 10, 1998: ""Determined not to give up, Pedley moved his fictional nation once again, this time to Taongi atoll in the Western Pacific. According to a Melchizedek press release, posted on its home page, Taongi was leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of ""the kingdom of EnenKio,"" another only-in- cyberspace country, which in this case claims the U.S.-held Wake Island. In real life, Taongi is an uninhabited atoll in the Marshall Islands."" http://www.feer.com/Restricted/index_corrections.html (link to article of December 24, 1998: ""Fantasy Island"", disconnected as of 2/1/00) Response to the author: I am unable to locate the ""Melchizedek press release"" you cited, indicating that ""...Taongi was leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of ""the kingdom of EnenKio,..."". Such an act would be impossible and implausible as EnenKio has no legal authority or political jurisdiction over Taongi Atoll in the Marshall Islands. Further more, Melchizedek (DOM) is not so uninformed as to publicly advertise an illegal act in the midst of attempting to find a suitable land base for its people to administer their form of government. The Kingdom of EnenKio did enter into a treaty with DOM on the 19th day of September, 1997, but it did not convey a lease of land. It declared a state of peace and established diplomatic recognition between our governments. However, a prior agreement, signed in May 1997, which had nothing to do with the Kingdom of EnenKio, transferred Mr. Robert Moore's rights to develop Taongi from Mr. Moore to DOM. It did not convey a lease at that time and no such document is in existence. This was made possible because Mr. Moore is the Alab (one class of landowner) of Taongi and had a legal power of attorney pertaining to Taongi Atoll, from the principal landowner, Iroijlaplap (Paramount Chief) Murjel Hermios, who was aware of and supported the transaction. Consideration, if any, under the agreement was personally retained by Mr. Moore, who is also the adopted brother of Hermios. Now, please understand, that while Mr. Moore was acting in the latter case on his own behalf, and that of the future use and development of Taongi, which would have generated an income to Iroijlaplap Hermios, Mr. Moore wears another hat as Minister Plenipotentiary of the Kingdom of EnenKio. Iroijlaplap Hermios, also wore (he died in December 10, 1998, the same date of your article) other hats: one as First Monarch, King of the Kingdom of EnenKio and one as owner in allodium of Eneen-Kio Atoll (a.k.a. Enen-kio, Halcyon, Disclerta, Wake and several other names). For you to state the Kingdom of EnenKio is ""...another only-in- cyberspace country..."", as you did in the above article, is not only a completely and categorically false statement, but it is a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of EnenKio. And, it is a blatant deceptive intrusion upon His Majesty King Hermios, the sovereign of EnenKio and Eneen-Kio Atoll, and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of your journalistic license -- unless, of course, your statement could be proved accurate. I suggest you do a little more research, not only into the establishment and development of the Kingdom of EnenKio, but into the prehistoric history and more recent U.S. invasion of Eneen-Kio Atoll, properly named by 'Marshallese' centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries.

""Enenkio Atoll- In 1898, the United States annexed Wake Island, in the Marshall Islands of the western Pacific. After the Marshalls became a U.S. Trust Territory, the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that Wake Island was a part of the Marianas chain, and pressed their historical claims to the atoll, called Enenkio locally. The U.S. government has consistently ignored these claims. The protests took a sharper turn after the U.S. Congress in 1993 acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by Americans of the Republic of Hawai'i. King Murjel Hermios, who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the northern Marshalls, declared Wake Island's independence in 1987. The Marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained its independence. In return for his services as Minister Plenipotentiary in the United States, Hermios granted American businessman Robert Moore land on Taongi Atoll in the northern Marshalls, which Moore has declared the Dominion of Melchizedek."" Comment: With all candor, I cannot figure how such straight forward facts such as we have presented to the public and over the Internet since 1994 could have possibly been construed into the above referenced text. While I am pleased to find you have apparently taken a very serious interest (unless your site is intended as some twisted joke, which I am assuming is not the case) in the history of the Kingdom of EnenKio, I am aghast at how distorted, erroneous and misleading your summary is. As a consequence of my service to His Majesty King Remios and the people of EnenKio, I will respectfully offer the following line by line correction. For your convenience, your text will be set off (with ""**"") in color: **In 1898, the United States annexed Wake Island, in the Marshall Islands of the western Pacific.** Correction: In 1898, the United States invaded Wake Island, the northernmost atoll -- actually named Eneen-Kio centuries before western explorers arrived -- of the Ratak chain of Marshall Islands in Micronesia and the Central North Pacific Ocean. The Author responds: ""Rest assured that I did not mean to downplay the role of violence in the American acquisition of the territory."" **After the Marshalls became a U.S. Trust Territory, the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that Wake Island was a part of the Marianas chain, and pressed their historical claims to the atoll, called Enenkio locally.** Correction: Following W.W.II, the Trust Territories of the Pacific, which included the Marshall Islands, was placed under administration of the United States by the United Nations. While Eneen-Kio was well established as one of the Marshalls, the U.S. only knew it as Wake and, having lost many U.S. lives there in 1941 at the hands of Japanese invaders, kept control of it. In 1993, the Paramount Chief of the Ratak atolls pressed his clan's historical and lawful claim to the 3 islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll. The Author responds: ""I don't see much conflict between the two versions here."" **The U.S. government has consistently ignored these claims.** Correction: The U.S. government has consistently ignored claims from the Marshall Islands government, which failed to exert a claim during its move to independence in 1979, and from the former traditional landowners, including Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios. The Author responds: ""I will note this."" **The protests took a sharper turn after the U.S. Congress in 1993 acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by Americans of the Republic of Hawai'i.** Correction: The Eneen-Kio claims gained some new momentum after precedents were set by the U.S. Congress, when in 1993 they acknowledged the illegality of the 1893 overthrow of the Monarch of the Kingdom of Hawai'i by a group of American businessmen and U.S. Marines, and in the following year returned the island of Kaho'olawe to the Hawaiian People. **King Murjel Hermios, who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the northern Marshalls, declared Wake Island's independence in 1987.** Correction: King Murjel Hermios, who was Paramount Chief until his death in December 1998, declared the sovereign state of EnenKio in 1994, whereupon the people chose him as their King over Eneen-Kio Atoll, ratified the Constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy. The Author responds: ""I will make the necessary corrections here."" **The Marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained its independence. In return for his services as Minister Plenipotentiary in the United States, Hermios granted American businessman Robert Moore land on Taongi Atoll in the northern Marshalls, which Moore has declared the Dominion of Melchizedek.** Correction: After the death of the First Monarch, his brother Remios succeeded to the throne as Second Monarch and rules along with his brother, Crown Prince Lobadreo, over the Kingdom of EnenKio today. To continue the commentary: The parts left out were either wrong or have nothing to do with the history of the Kingdom of EnenKio itself. Since HM King Remios also succeeded to Iroijlaplap of the northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands, he also has responsibilities over 10 atolls, 2 islands and over 300 atoll islets. But that is another story, which has nothing directly to do with the Kingdom of EnenKio. I have offered this treatise in hopes that you will find the time to correct your site per my suggestions. Please feel free to contact me or view our pages at the address above. Thank you in advance for your attention and interest in this matter. The Author responds: ""I imagine that you are asserting here that Moore's Melchizedek project (which can be located on the web through the Sources & Bibliography section of my web page) is non-existent. Be assured I will look further into\par this. Thank you again for your response, Captain Rydell. I should be posting a revised version of the page in the next week or so."" (June 7, 1999) SKIP TO NEXT FILE �TOP OF PAGE June 1, 1999: News Release Part One Background: On May 21, 1999, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands posted a ""press release"" on the Internet at: http://www.yokwe.net/mboard/newsinfo/thread.cgi?67,0\cf0 (discontinued as of 12/1/00). The author, ""Mr. Joseph Biglar, Undersecretary"", is not known to us, has not heretofore communicated with the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, nor with its Monarch, His Majesty King Remios, at any time and has no knowledge of any policies or state activities of EnenKio. There is no valid reason to assume that the said ""press release"" is indeed an official document. The Republic of the Marshall Islands has perfect knowledge that representatives of the Kingdom of EnenKio, headed by His Majesty King Remios, on the basis of his proper and lawful authority, have the right and obligation to speak in support of the interests of certain persons, many of whom happen to be Marshallese nationals residing in the Marshall Islands. Response to so-called ""Press Release"": This unprovoked attack upon His Majesty King Remios, Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands is wholly false. It is also unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to little more than an unquestionable confirmation of the predilection for infringement upon Marshallese sovereign rights exercised by the current administration of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, which has been confirmed by the U.S. State Department. (See: Human Rights Report) This public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the Marshall Islands Government that any attempt to interfere in the business of His Majesty King Remios, Iroijlaplap of the Northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands, or any acts, decisions, mandates, announcements or directives thereby, shall be met with definitive responses equal to the degrees of contravention. The RMI is unequivocally cognizant that the Kingdom of EnenKio: �� �� exists as a sovereign state as defined by the Montevideo Convention (1933). �� �� was conceived as a separate independent state by its sovereign, Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios, in 1987. �� �� was established by way of a public authority, the Constitution of the Kingdom of EnenKio Atoll, ratified in 1994 by its people. �� �� has negotiated diplomatic and trade treaties with many other states, including the Dominion of Melchizedek �� �� has asserted political and territorial jurisdiction over islands and seas which lie entirely outside and well beyond the area defined as - now quoting Mr. Biglar's statement - ""RMI geographical and political boundaries."" �� �� exercises authorities founded upon prehistoric traditional and matriarchal ancestral rights and titles bestowed, under the sacred heritage of Marshallese customary law (reinforced by the RMI Constitution), upon the acknowledged Iroijlaplaps of the Northern Ratak atolls, whose authority is certainly not subject to scrutiny by Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. �� �� has not subjugated, assigned or encumbered any of its political jurisdiction within its defined territorial boundaries of islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll to the government or people of the Dominion of Melchizedek or to any other entity, including the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Mr. Biglar is unequivocally cognizant that the Republic of the Marshall Islands: �� �� also exists as a sovereign state, defined by the Montevideo Convention (1933). �� �� was conceived as a separate state by (UN) foreign governments, which included the United States, China and the USSR. �� �� was also established under a public authority, the Constitution of the Marshall Islands, ratified in 1979 by its people. �� �� has no relations with EnenKio that allows RMI knowledge of anything that is not also public information and no such public information respecting relations with the Dominion of Melchizedek has ever been disseminated to harm the RMI to be condemned by Mr. Biglar. �� �� has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll, which was not incorporated into the RMI in 1979, nor subsequently incorporated by any act, law or mandate of any present or former Iroijlaplap or Monarch thereof and any statement to the contrary is fraudulent, as in the instant matter. �� �� exercises authorities founded upon the RMI Constitution, which does not incorporate nor authorize political jurisdiction over territorial boundaries that include the islands or seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll and any statement to the contrary is fraudulent, as in the instant matter. �� �� has refused to acknowledge the leadership of the Kingdom of EnenKio in their every attempt to get the RMI government to mitigate the suffering of people residing in the Ratak atolls, under jurisdiction of Iroijlaplap Hermios, and the RMI has rejected every suggestion to coordinate prospective relief efforts through the said Iroijlaplap Hermios. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands is steadfastly advised that any unilateral statements or actions by the administration of the Republic of the Marshall Islands which purport, seek or serve to diminish or question the credibility, existence or authority of the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio in the conduct of its affairs of state, without legitimate authentication by a court of competent jurisdiction, are hereafter to be taken as deliberate acts of aggression upon the Monarch of the Kingdom, His Majesty King Remios, as Head of State, the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio and its people, and will be countered with appropriate responsive measures. Furthermore, in light of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands announcement concerning the Kingdom of EnenKio, your attention is respectfully directed to the following statement in the Preamble of the Constitution of the Marshall Islands, then you decide for yourself: ""With this Constitution, we affirm our desire and right to live in peace and harmony, subscribing to the principles of democracy, sharing the aspirations of all other peoples for a free and peaceful world, and striving to do all we can to assist in achieving this goal."" On behalf of His Majesty King Remios, we, administrators of the Kingdom of EnenKio, have wholeheartedly agreed to pursue the same goal for a free and peaceful world and have made no effort to the contrary.

[Paragraph 4] Thus, it is now possible for an enterprising jurisdiction anywhere in the world to establish itself as an emerging OFC. The newest OFCs, e.g., Niue and the Marshall Islands, are now sprouting in remote areas of the world, such as the Pacific. Even more ""remote"" are mere figments of fertile imaginations such as the Dominion of Malchizedek (sic) or The Kingdom of Enenkio Atol (sic), both entirely fraudulent in intent and practice."" [note: OFC = Offshore Financial Center] Response: This unprovoked attack upon His Majesty King Remios, Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, the sovereign state of EnenKio and its noble citizenry by the U.S. Department of State is a reprehensible categorically false challenge of the sovereignty of the Kingdom of EnenKio. It is also unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to an unqualified felonious defamation of the international reputation of His Majesty King Remios, the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio and organs thereof. The unmitigated audacity and arrogance of the United States to attempt to link the Kingdom of EnenKio with International Crime, narcotics trafficking, money laundering, tax evasion, international drug cartels, terrorists, bank fraud or any other sort of criminal activity, without even one microscopic fragment of substantive evidence to corroborate such deliberately nefarious statements is reprehensible in the least. This public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the United States Government that any attempt to interfere in the business of His Majesty King Remios, Iroijlaplap of the Northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands, or any acts, decisions, mandates, announcements or directives thereby, shall be met with definitive responses equal to the degrees of contravention. Furthermore, this matter will not be resolved until the President of the United States issues a formal apology to His Majesty King Remios, along with the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, and the Congress of the United States initiates a thorough investigation into the abuses of power, subversion of natural rights and illegal occupation by the United States of the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll. Congressional representatives to Hawaii, the nearest State of the United States to Eneen-Kio Atoll, and those of other states, have repeatedly been advised of the foregoing atrocities and conditions and have failed to respond in kind. The United States is obligated as the self-assured trustee of Pacific Island States in Micronesia to respond to the charges of ""ethnic cleansing"" and her responsibility to EnenKio is no less.

SKIP TO NEXT FILE �TOP OF PAGE March 1999 -- Comments to readers from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Subject: A ""State of War"" Declaration The Kingdom of EnenKio recognizes that an unresolved conflict of interests exists between it and the United States Government.�� The United States government, admittedly at a time of colonial expansionism, appears to have violated the laws of nature and The Law of Nations in ""taking possession"" of sovereign property in the Northern Ratak State, which then had formal treaties with the Republic of Germany.�� The explicitly immoral and illegal 1899 seizure of Marshallese homeland by agents of the federal government was the start of present day sentiments of deprivation of rights and dispossession of lands felt by many Marshallese.�� Because of continual neglect misrepresentation and outright exploitation, these scars on Marshallese society have not healed. Thus a current state of adversity exists.�� Following four years of attempts to cause the United States to evaluate the plight of the Marshallese of the Northern Ratak imposed by its actions with respect to Wake Island, the government of EnenKio, on behalf of the Marshallese King, issued the ""'State of War', a Declaration"" and broadcast it to the world.�� The people were displaced from their native lands and kept as virtual prisoners of war, not by virtue of being kept in, but by virtue of being kept out.�� It was through this pragmatic initiative that the Kingdom of EnenKio solicited support to heal the wounds inflicted upon the people and peacefully restore what was wrongfully taken from the ancestors of the Ratak Paramount Chief, King Murjel Hermios. In retrospect, the Declaration has had little visible effect.�� While a state of adversity does exist, the hope for American recognition of past wrongs remains on the horizon.�� The Kingdom of EnenKio does not condone nor tacitly sanction any act of belligerence by any person or agent of any government.�� Such unnecessary means would diminish any hope of mutual reconciliation and could diplomatically undermine the cause of peace within the family of nations.�� The Kingdom of EnenKio also does not wish to see any further damage to the remnant happiness of the Marshallese people. While the Kingdom of EnenKio continues to seek accountability of the U.S. Congress to obey its own laws, to conform to the UN Charter, conventions of the United Nations relating to self-determination, preservation of human rights and protection against human rights abuses, it believes accountability requires the U.S. to meet the pleas of the people oppressed by the conditions of this adversity.�� The refusal of the U.S. to meet its obligations, even to the extent that a simple discussion for resolution is held over the subject matter with representatives for the affected parties, perpetuates the adversity, turns a cold shoulder to the facts of abuse and ignores the rights of the Marshallese people to whom the U.S. pledged in good faith to execute the 1947 mandates of the United Nations and its members.�� Your understanding is appreciated.�� SKIP TO NEXT FILE �TOP OF PAGE December 19, 1998: News Release Subject: Death of the Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio The government has declared a period of national mourning on the occasion of the death of the first Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, His Majesty King Murjel Hermios. Embassies, missions and regional posts are instructed to display the flag at half-staff until 11 January 1999. Memorial services, held in the Marshall Islands where HM Hermios made his home, mark the passing of one of the most unpretentious of traditional Marshallese leaders. His remains will be interred in a family plot on one of the outer islands he so loved. Irooj Hermios was Head of State of the Kingdom of EnenKio, revered as Monarch over the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, esteemed as Iroijlaplap and High Chief of the Northern atolls of the Ratak Archipelago, beloved as our brother and trusted as a friend. His successor as Iroijlaplap is to be formally named by a Council of traditional leaders. Selection of a successor to the Monarchy of the Kingdom is in process and will be announced at a later date. In the interim, a Reagent will serve as Head of State. HM Hermios followed a long line of matriarchal predecessors as Iroijlaplap. Aboriginal inhabitants of the islands today known as the Marshalls, part of Micronesia in the North Pacific Ocean and first discovered by European seamen in the 16th Century, were found to have a well-developed societal structure. Many nations have since, mostly by force, prevailed over the Marshall Islands, imposed unaccustomed western ideals upon her populace and ravaged her islands of resources and beauty. Today this area is commonly known as Wake atoll and is illegally occupied by the federal government of the United States. In one of the most courageous acts in recent times, Irooj Hermios clearly understood he had a mission to succeed where his predecessors in interest had failed to secure the islands, seas and lagoon of Eneen-Kio Atoll for his beloved people. (The account of his acts to establish the Kingdom of EnenKio as an island state, independent of the governments of the Marshalls and the United States, may be researched at the official Internet site. On behalf of the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, we are extremely grateful for his dedication to the people of the Marshall Islands and are personally moved by the memory of a man who will surely one day be recognized as having a legacy of furthering the interests of his people by the setting of processes in motion to re-establish Marshallese domination over Eneen-Kio Atoll. We are saddened that our brother has passed without his seeing the fruits of his devotion to Marshallese ancestry and traditions.

News Article SKIP TO NEXT FILE �TOP OF PAGE July 14, 1998: Communiqu�� to Correspondents Recent articles defaming the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio have been maliciously published under the guise of a Marshall Islands government warning against ""fraudulent claims"". We have once more admonished the writer of the articles in the Marshall Islands for disregarding indisputable facts which clearly discredit his biased report. We urge you to disregard all discourse in the media regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio which are not validated. To that end, you are cordially invited to contact this office with your specific questions or concerns. For your advice, the following statement was issued by the State Secretary of the Kingdom in reply: The Kingdom has never knowingly made any fraudulent claim whatsoever. No claim we have made has ever been shown to be fraudulent, nor has any claim ever come under or faltered from a challenge by anyone anywhere in the world. We are working vigorously to regain occupation of the ancestral property of HM King Hermios, to resolve the virtual ""state of war"" that exists with the United States government and to be accepted as an honorable state among nations. The Kingdom does not pretend to be (quoting from the report) ""asserting authority over land ...within the geographical and political boundaries..."" of the RMI. We are however striving to expel the armed imperialistic invasion forces of the United States from the shores of Eneen-Kio Atoll so natural Marshallese supremacy can be re-establish there. As to allegations of fraud and constitutional violation, no one has dared to come forward with any such a charge. We say, let the issue be played out in the People's venue for the record, not in a libelous weekly publication. While we do not wear our brief history on our shirtsleeves, our raison d'��tre is clearly mandated in the Preamble to the Constitution of EnenKio, which can be seen at our web site: http://www.enenkio.wakeisland.org Referencing the news article in the Marshall Islands Journal entitled ""Kingdom of EnenKio sets up in New Zealand,"" of May 1st, the editor was advised, contrary to his report, that neither passports nor driver licenses can be purchased from the Kingdom's web site. The Kingdom of EnenKio DOES NOT SELL PASSPORTS! If you have evidence to the contrary, our Foreign Ministry would appreciate your furnishing it to them so steps can be taken immediately to investigate the matter. You are advised if anyone sells or offers to sell an EnenKio passport, that such an act is patently illegal. The published statement, ""The group ...claims to represent Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios and the atolls of the Ratak chain..."", is wholly false. I have explained this matter to the editor on several prior occasions and ample information is available at our Internet site to refute the statement. The Kingdom does not represent any area outside of its territorial boundaries, as the Ratak atolls surely are. Contrary to their libelous statements, the Kingdom of EnenKio was not ""created"" by Robert Moore and he is not a ""Honolulu-based attorney."" HM King Murjel Hermios is the acknowledged hereditary Iroijlaplap of the northern Ratak atolls and is also First Monarch of the Kingdom, not of his own choice, but by a legal process and free choice of our citizens who participated in the founding of the nation in 1994. Such a noble and peaceful beginning is not too uncommon in world history. ""Enenkio"" [sic] (actually Enen-kio or Eneen-Kio, in reference to the atoll itself) is the first Marshallese name for a Marshallese atoll located roughly 300 miles north of Bok-ak (Taongi) Atoll. ""Wake"" is a fictitious moniker applied to the re-discovered Eneen-Kio Atoll by unknown western society writers. SKIP TO NEXT FILE �TOP OF PAGE May 4, 1997: News Release Subject: Issuance of Gold Stamps The government of the Kingdom of EnenKio proudly announces commissioning of its Inaugural Issue of Gold Stamps. This announcement, made at the First Sunday Hawaii Stamp, Coin and Postcard Show May 4th, was the first pre-publication public notice of the issuance of Gold Stamps by the Kingdom. Stamps are expected to be off the presses by early June 1997. First day covers with new stamps affixed and postmarked official ""First Day of Issue"" by the Kingdom will be available for a limited time following the dates of release. Distributors, dealers and collectors are encouraged sign up as a charter member of the EnenKio Philatelic Mint mailing list. BACKGROUND - The Kingdom was established in March 1993, and the government was chosen by the people, who then ratified the constitution in September 1994. However, due to U.S. military activities on the island and the presence of armed occupation forces, the government of the Kingdom lingers in ""exile"". Several nations have extended recognition of the sovereignty of the Kingdom, documents of citizenship are being issued and legations are located in Europe, South America, USA and elsewhere. A NATION IN CONFLICT - The land in question, commonly known as Wake Island, is actually an atoll comprised of three small islands assigned names of westerners who visited them: Wake, Wilkes and Peale. Few people in the world today are aware that the native discoverers who named the atoll Eneen-Kio lived in the Marshall Islands, exercised constant jurisdiction and made regular use of it as a living food pantry and cultural site. By way of developing the atoll as a nation, the government is asserting that it is the indisputable holder of allodial title to ""Wake"" atoll and has the right to exercise its sovereignty at the will of the people. The United States of America began in a similar fashion not with a peaceful transition from colonial status. Lawful return of the land is grounded upon the legal precedent set by Congressional apology to Hawaiians for the 1893 overthrow of the Monarchy. ""STATE OF WAR"" - By way of an official March 1997 Declaration sent to top U.S. officials, the Kingdom of EnenKio has acknowledged that a virtual ""state of war"" now exists over the islands on account of the blatant acts of aggression and illegal armed invasions by troops from United States warships. The primary objective of the notice was to request a Congressional investigation into actual events and related factors surrounding the federal seizure of islands in the North Pacific Ocean by the United States. Calls to end U.S. operations, vacate the atoll and negotiate return of the islands to jurisdiction of the Kingdom have fallen on deaf ears. Despite repeated notices, letters and legal advertising, all major news media have consistently ignored the events and failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world regarding alleged incidents of piracy, waste and human rights violations by federal agents of the United States government. INAUGURAL ISSUE - The Gold Stamps are based on events of the past and dreams for the future of peace in the global community as the millennium nears. For that reason, the universal gold standard was chosen as the basis for evaluation. Since the relative value of gold in world markets varies according to the value and stability of national currency units, the stamps will similarly reflect changes in price when purchased with any particular currency. However, the real or intrinsic value of the stamps will remain as constant as gold. The extrinsic value will be determined by philatelic collectors around the world. Note: Stamps are printed on paper stock, do not contain gold metal and are not intended for use as money. CLOSING COMMENTS - The government of the Kingdom appeals to all people from every peaceable nation in the world to recognize the Kingdom of EnenKio as a sovereign nation promoting peace in the Pacific region. In doing so, it seeks a peaceful resolution o f the ""state of war"" with the federal government of the United States and asks that everyone with human rights concerns use their influence accordingly. The proceeds from the sale of Gold Stamps will help fund the restoration of the Kingdom and end the conflict in peace. SKIP TO NEXT FILE �TOP OF PAGE March 31, 1997: News Release An official document entitled A Declaration, was sent March 22 to top Executive and Legislative officials in the federal government of the United States, including selected Cabinet members. The document asserts that: ""A STATE OF WAR EXISTS OVER THE KINGDOM OF ENENKIO ATOLL BY WAY OF ACTS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES."" This is the most recent attempt to captivate the attention of the federal government. One of the primary objectives of this action is to bring about a Congressional investigation into the true events and factors surrounding the illegal seizure of islands in the North Pacific Ocean by the United States. This latest position statement is one in a succession of dozens of disclosures, statements, letters and legal actions taken since the government of the Kingdom was established in March 1993, each with similar objectives. Calls for the U.S. to cease operations, vacate the premises, negotiate return of the island to the King, apologize and compensate him for use, abuse and illegal hold-over following legal action have all failed to receive cognizance or reply from the federal government. Likewise, despite repeated notices, letters and legal announcements, major news media have consistently ignored the events and failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world regarding the alleged piracy, arrogance and human rights violations by the United States. The land in question, commonly called Wake Island, is comprised of three small islands, Wake, Wilkes and Peale, named by ""Western explorers"" for Western persons. What of the native discoverers? The crux of the issue is that despite the passage of ownership via a complex Matriarchal land tenure system for over two millennia with jurisdiction by the aboriginal chiefs of the Northern Ratak atolls of Marshall Islands, the United States seems to believe it is justified in having seized the atoll in 1898, and again in1899. Historical records reveal that the multiple landings by United States warships, en route to the Philippines on war missions, and subsequent Congressional action, were the sole basis of the U.S. claim. The motivation was said to be for the establishment of a cable station to improve communications with its marauding troops in the East. Such a station was never established at Wake Island. It was destined to become a military installation. However, formal protests of the seizure was sent to the U.S. President by the German Consul in the Marshall Islands and some measure of correspondence followed. But since the U.S. abandoned the area without establishing a colony or cable station and Germany was defeated in the first World War, the objections fell into oblivion. It is understood from written accounts of oral Marshallese culture and traditions, that jurisdiction and use of the atoll by natives continued. The U.S. did not establish a settlement there until, under a lease in 1934, the CAA (predecessor of the FAA) allowed Pan American Airways to build a base for its fleet of trans-pacific seaplanes. Clearly, the so-called annexation by the U.S. is grossly flawed, the occupation patently illegal and its ""ownership"" is held therefore to be wholly invalid. When the U.S. Congress apologized for the overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy in 1993 and the U.S. Navy subsequently returned culturally significant land to the ""natives"" of Hawaii, a landmark legal precedent was thus set for comparable action with respect to the return of Wake Island. The islands of Eneen-Kio, as the northernmost atoll in the Ratak chain, played a very significant role in the culture and religion of Micronesians living in the more ""hospitable"" islands of the Marshall group. While not being used for Navy target practice as Kaho'olawe was, the use of the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll and the military mission at Wake Airfield are decidedly without substantial merit and whereby activities take place in secrecy, devoid of scrutiny, oversight or quintessential knowledge by the American public. Even after cultural intervention in the mid 1800s by Christian Missionaries, natives continued to use Eneen-Kio, authority to go there being issued by the Ratak Iroijlaplap (Paramount Chief). King Murjel Hermios holds that title today. By way of developing the atoll in sovereignty as a nation, the government is thereby indisputable holder of the allodial title to Wake Island. The U.S. cannot produce a title. The Hermios ancestral lineage, passage of title through the ages from aboriginal inhabitants and discoverers, who gave the atoll its Marshallese name, their continual use and legacy of jurisdiction secures the rights of ownership. Upon the basis of events and actions by the United States, the administration of the Kingdom of EnenKio, by virtue of the Declaration, ""yields to the recognition that a State of War"" exists over the island nation. This is not, however, to be viewed as a waiver of rights or unconditional surrender. Sovereignty and independence of the Kingdom, over all other claims, is forthrightly reasserted. The belief is that truth and law is on the side of the Kingdom and that reckless abuse of power and a trail of human rights violations are chronicled upon the record of U.S. ""ownership"" and occupation. Native North Americans are all too well acquainted with this brand of federal brutality when it comes to seizure of land and denial of rights. In the Declaration, demands are made as follows: �� �� ""...to come to the table of peace to negotiate an honorable accord for the survivors of the said STATE OF WAR..."". �� �� ""If unwilling to voluntarily negotiate for peace, to submit to Impartial international arbitration of the terms for surrender and WAR reparations to citizens."" �� �� ""...to cease and desist, effective immediately, all and every action of every kind in or on EnenKio Atoll or within the 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone..."" �� �� ""...to pay that certain debt, perfected and established in commerce by failure the Department of the Interior �� �� ""...to lawfully respond to proper legal notices of more than TWENTY-SEVEN consecutive months and most recently referenced by a Certified Invoice, No. 97-US-03, dated March 10, 1997, for which it is obligated to pay."" �� �� That the ""...Congress of the United States is obliged to immediately impanel an impartial body for the purpose of investigating the atrocities committed in the case of the violations of human rights and due process..."". The government of the Kingdom solicits every other sovereign peaceable nation in the world to give effective and adequate recognition to the Kingdom of EnenKio Atoll as an Independent Nation under God. It seeks a peaceful resolution of the state of war with the federal government of the United States and asks them to use their influence accordingly. Appeals are being made to the United Nations. News Article SKIP TO NEXT FILE �TOP OF PAGE February 6, 1995: News Release On behalf of His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios, Monarch of EnenKio Atoll, titular head of State, Paramount Chief (Iroijlaplap) of the northern atolls of the Ratak archipelago of Pacific Ocean Islands of the Marshall Islands, I bid you a warm Marshallese greeting -- Yokwe! The purpose of this notice is twofold: First, to admonish those of you to whom word of the referenced issues were made known, then failed to take action; Second, to encourage you to whom this presents to take appropriate action in disseminating reports on this issue. As long as you remain quiet, safely removed from the potential controversy insidiously lurking beneath the surface of one issue about which the federal government of the United States remains resolutely silent, your anonymity and that of your publication is well served. Summary of Events 1993-94: Two official press releases have been made regarding the establishment of a new island nation in the Pacific Ocean, EnenKio, formerly known as Wake Island. The first was issued on February 25, 1994. It followed two announcements: 1) officials of the US Air Force at Hickam AFB, Hawaii said in articles published New Year's Eve and Day in both Honolulu newspapers that the USAF no longer wanted to maintain Wake Island airfield and wanted to turn it over to Interior Department or another military organization by 1 February and abandon it by 1 October, 1994; 2) US Army Space and Strategic Defense Command of Huntsville, Alabama issued an Environmental Impact Assessment for a proposed missile launch program out of Wake Island; part of the ""star wars"" program, I am led to believe. An emergency meeting of the leaders of the future nation of EnenKio was held and it was decided that earlier efforts to bring the atoll under the jurisdiction of Hawaii would be abandoned in favor of affirmation of independence, thus seeking self-rule under the natural landowner as king. Letters to Mr. Clinton, members of Congress, U.S. Army and the first press release proclaimed the status of ownership of EnenKio (Wake I., Peale I., Wilkes I.), denounced the Army's so-called ""no significant impact"" scheme to fire more than 800 rockets of an undisclosed nature into and over the waters of the Marshall Islands (including its sanctuaries for turtles and birds) and asserted rightful ownership claims. On March 21, 1994, a formal resolution was executed establishing the nation of EnenKio as an independent nation under the authority of His Majesty Murjel Hermios, who had granted special power of attorney to Mr. Robert Moore, appointed Minister Plenipotentiary. The Constitution, Succession Act and other documents were thereafter drafted. On September 30th, a formal Declaration of Sovereignty was signed into law by Ministers and selected delegate citizens, believing (as did the USA founding fathers) that such power was an inherent right of the people. It declared the Kingdom of EnenKio a sovereign independent peaceful nation, it acknowledged His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios as owner in allodium of the atoll, accepted him as Head of State and embraced the Constitution as the founding document for a form of democratic government. Documents and letters were sent to numerous nations of the world proclaiming the above actions. Formal documents of recognition were presented, offer of diplomatic ties made and support for reciprocation requested. Copies of pertinent documents were forwarded to the United Nations, UN Security Council, NATO, South Pacific Commission and others. Letters of personal appeal were sent to UN leaders. A special request for protection and assistance was sent to the UN Security Council. On October 10th, a commercial affidavit and demand for payment was sent via certified mail to federal officers of the United States regarding the illegal January 17, 1899 seizure, under force of arms, of the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, the adverse occupation and continued disregard of international Human rights law, UN Charter terms and terms of the Compact of Free Association with the Republic of the Marshall Islands (Public Law 99-239; January 14, 1986). Having acknowledged receipt and failing to respond within a reasonable time, the U.S. is now in default under commercial law, owing in excess of US$100 million. The second official press release was issued on November 21, 1994, relating the preceding events. Of all the agencies to whom it was sent, only two, the Marshall Islands Journal, a weekly newspaper and Islands Business Pacific magazine are known to have mentioned the story, then only briefly. Request for Media Response: The thirst of the media for copy on topics outside of natural calamities, treed cats and daily courtroom chronicles of violence and deception seems seriously lacking. Is not the peaceful beginning of a new nation news any more? Is not the restoration of native rights of an aboriginal society whose roots reach into antiquity (to before the birth of Jesus) worth a little journalistic investigation? How about suspicions of insidious military-sanctioned activity which threatens the security and peaceful existence of nations of the Pacific in the name of ""world leadership""? Or is it world domination? People of EnenKio have a few simple requests of you, the media, in an effort to draw international attention to this issue and thereby, hopefully shorten the delay in regaining active occupation of islands of their ancestral heritage: 1. Investigate and verify the circumstances of the illegal armed invasion supported by U.S. expansionism and subsequent improper annexation of the sacred islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, then being utilized by sailors, hunters and chiefs of the Marshallese civilization and for at least 2000 years prior to the 1899 fiasco. (Note: These facts and validity of the Hermios claim are a matter of historical record, not a fabrication.) 2. Investigate and/or verify the circumstances of any evidence of specific beneficial use and U.S. policy, past and present, or the lack thereof, with regard to the role of EnenKio . (Note: It is my understanding Wake was ""decommissioned"" after the so-called ""processing"" of thousands of South Vietnamese refugees in the late 1970s). 3. Reflect on the contrasting history of U.S. occupation, war, technological advances, in light of modern attitudes about misdeeds against native peoples and the willingness of our people to develop serious national economic programs for the benefit of all mankind. 4. Respectfully and conscientiously broadcast the credibility of the king's claim of allodial title, the declaration of rights of the citizens of EnenKio to self-determination and the commitment by their government and leaders to promulgate their mandates in a responsible and fiscal manner. 5. Bring to light U.S. strategy with regard to the implementation of questionable and costly pet programs involving nuclear proliferation, offensive/defensive weapon systems, clandestine military research, environmental pollution and whatever else is going on there. (Note: Congress and certain federal agencies have promoted use of Wake Island and environs as platform for launching and testing hundreds of rockets and missiles, a federal prison for drug offenders and other less publicized projects.) 6. Fully disclose to the people of the United States U.S. strategy with regard to the denial of possession of lawful title to Eneen-Kio Atoll by King Hermios as a consequence of natural inheritance via time-honored and respected Marshallese matriarchal traditions, disregard for Human rights protected under international law, United Nations Charter and conventions and the U.S. Compact with the Marshall Islands and refusal to acknowledge liability for acts of piracy on the high seas of military and colonial expansionism of the nineteenth century. (Note: U.S. apology for the illegal armed overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy the prior year and the return of the Hawaiian island, Kaho'olawe, also of religious significance, has set precedents for the action demanded by EnenKio citizens.) Parting Shot: What truly concerns me is the cavalier attitude of government in general, the U.S. federal government more precisely, which somehow behaves as if endowed by a divinely inspired alchemy that conveys the right to rearrange lands, cultures and economics with out the slightest inclination to counsel with those people most concerned. Such an approach might be expected in some dictatorship in some distant corner of the globe, but considering its present source, it is downright alarming. It is worthwhile to mention here that despite a prominent trail left over the course of more than two years, letters, reports, forms, published articles, press releases, legal notices, documents and virtually every action initiated by those representing King Hermios have escaped official response from officers of the U.S. federal government. Our not-too-distant past is replete with examples of the insatiable thirst of western ""civilized"" nations for doctrines faithful to the cry of ""manifest destiny"" which clearly marked American foreign policy of a century ago. If this current trend signifies a resurgence, it can only be considered a giant leap backward, considering the flimsy record of American attempts at ""fixing up the world"". The title of ownership and inheritance of Eneen-Kio Atoll pre-dates formation of the United States by two centuries or more. It is time the significance of native cultures and recognition of their right to self-determination is elevated from matters of scientific discourse to mainstream political involvement in determining the future course of human endeavor. People have a right to know; the media a responsibility to show them. In conclusion, I reiterate that our focus, from my point of view, is one, not so much of opposition to the ominous might of U.S. political philosophy and military prowess, but of asserting the moral imperatives for correcting errors of the past, supporting restoration of Human cultural dignity and the unobstructed observance of God-given individual rights. Thank you for your support and cooperation in helping end the siege and forced exile of our proud citizenry. TOP OF PAGE November 21, 1994: News Release In a bid to regain occupation of that portion of his ancestral lands which include Wake Island, site of a U.S. military outpost, His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios, through his legal representative, Minister Plenipotentiary, Robert Moore, the U.S. has been given the boot out of Wake Island. Moore served legal notice on top U.S. government officials in October 1994 to cease all activity and leave the islands. The filing came on the heels of a five-year struggle to gain recognition of the illegal seizure of islands (owned by predecessors of King Hermios) by the gun boat, USS Bennington in 1899. The legal document, a Commercial Affidavit, Declaration of Fair Value and Demand for Payment, was served under recognized principles of Common Law and International Commercial Codes. It details the specifics of King Hermios' ancestral rights to Wake Island, the illegality of the U.S. claim and violations of native laws, International Agreements and human rights during their 95-year hold on the Hermios property. It also establishes default, recognized under law, by reason of failure to answer the sworn claims, thereby allowing the Hermios claim to stand valid before the law as unchallenged. Under those claims, demand was made for payment of 94.7 million dollars for past use of the land. Continued use and holdover of the atoll will add 5 million dollars per month through 1995. While putting forth the appearance of advocating human rights, U.S. officials continue to ignore issues right in their own backyard which keep King Hermios and the citizens of EnenKio living in compulsory exile. Eneen-Kio Atoll, a name derived from Marshallese traditions involving a small orange (kio) flower found there, is made up of 3 islands, including Wake. Predecessors in interest of King Hermios, aboriginal chiefs and islanders sailed native canoes to Eneen-Kio Atoll for religious and cultural purposes as much as 500 years BC. During the colonial invasion of Pacific islands, western traders and explorers consistently ignored the native traditions and rights of the real discoverers of those fragile and isolated bits of sand, the islanders themselves. A case in point is in that of the Hawaiians, who recently gained an apology from the U.S. Congress and President Bill Clinton for the illegal U.S. government overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy. King Hermios is presently acknowledged as the hereditary Paramount Chief (Iroijlaplap) of all the Northern Atolls of the Ratak Archipelago of the Marshall Islands, which terminates to the north, beyond Eneen-Kio Atoll. Mr. Moore has full authority to act on the King's behalf to rid the islands of their illegal and unwanted Occupation Forces in favor of restoring the King's assertion of his native allodial rights. Most recently occupying and holding the islands are agents of the U.S. Air Force command, 15th Logistics Group, Hickam AFB, Hawaii. Nearly identical articles published in the Star Bulletin and Honolulu Advertiser on December 31, 1993 and January 1, 1994 headlined: ""Air Force willing to give up its hold on Wake Island"" and stated: ""Not much activity there anymore, so the Air Force wants to give up control"". According to some theories thought to have reliable foundation, private entities or other government agencies are fighting for control behind a stonewall of apathy, denial and contempt for traditional ancestral heritage of King Hermios, his predecessors and people. Mr. Moore is also charged with the responsibility of bringing the nation under active jurisdiction of its own independent government, to initiate and administer to its citizens, promote economic development and to direct all affairs of State. The democratic government is established as a limited constitutional monarchy and is being directed by its Executive Council. Since 1987, despite repeated efforts to resolve the conflict and the effects of a stroke, Mr. Moore has been unsuccessful in getting any substantive reply from officers of the United States, military officers and members of Congress. The following is a summary of some of the recent letters, inquiries and statements of claims made on behalf of the lawful and rightful landowner, King Murjel Hermios: �� �� Formal letters to President Clinton and Vice-President Al Gore in February 1993, requesting consideration under programs promised in their campaign for economic conversion of old military bases were ignored. As a military base, Wake Airfield was ""decommissioned"" more than a decade ago. �� �� In response to the Environmental Assessment of the proposed Theater Missile Defense Rocket Launch Activities, formal letters of protest sent to the Pentagon and U.S. Army officials, who contemplated launching hundreds of missiles from Wake Island over several years into the waters of the Marshall Islands, went unanswered. �� �� Letters to members of the U.S. Congress protesting rocket launch activities and requesting help went unanswered. �� �� A Resolution dated March 21, 1994 was signed which declared the status of EnenKio to be that of an independent nation under the administrative jurisdiction of King Murjel Hermios. It was likewise ignored. After waiting for more than 580 days since ""formal"" notification of the declared status of EnenKio and having heard no objection from the United States, Mr. Moore assembled the Ministers of the Executive Council. They, along with a few involved citizens living in exile and denied access to Eneen-Kio, formally passed and signed the Declaration of Sovereignty on September 30, 1994. They also accepted the draft of the Constitution which establishes the democratic principles of government recognizing His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios as Head of State and his family as the First Royal Family of EnenKio . While the King and his people bear no ill will against the multitudes of foreign invaders of Eneen-Kio Atoll, which over the centuries included agents of the Emperor of Japan, the Emperor of Germany, and the King of Spain, they believe the time has come to acknowledge the errors of the past, correct the conditions thereby produced and move on into the future in support of the sacred principals of Truth, Honor and Peace. Those principals are embodied in the Constitutions of EnenKio and of the United States. Those tenets were likewise embodied, affirmed and ratified by the U.S. Congress in Public Law 99-239 (Jan. 14, 1986), signed by President Ronald Reagan as the Compact of Free Association with the Marshall Islands and Federated States of Micronesia. The compact acknowledges superiority of all Marshallese ""natural"" rights, including those of ownership and use of land. Still mindful of the terrible threat of extraordinary U.S. military 1 808 923-0476 fax/phone Robert Moore, Minister Plenipotentiary, Kingdom of EnenKio Foreign Trade Mission DO-MO-CO Manager, Remios Hermios Eleemosynary Trust, Majuro, Marshall Islands http://www.enenkio.org",spam

"It was the Spring of 1979. I was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school with buck-teeth and freckles. Each day in the cafeteria, I walked from table to table ... Stealing other kids' lunch money. No, I didn't rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made them a little deal. ""Let me borrow two dollars today,"" I said, ""and I'll bring you five dollars next week."" The investment was too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes. Of course when ""next week"" rolled around and I couldn't pony up the cash, I promised to pay them even more the week after that, if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit longer. Eventually the end of the year came and went, high school started and with it came girls, and homework, and parties, and sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more things on their mind than last year's lunch money. I made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid, and I didn't even get beat up. Hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market secrets you will ever learn. First of all, greed is your number one enemy. You're not going to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when you're ahead. Don't wait for the boat to sink before grabbing the lifejacket. Second, never trust an investment adviser of any kind. They are looking out for their own money, not yours. The ""professionals"", those stuffy investment counselors and money managers, will always tell you that the best time to buy is NOW. According to those guys, the longer you keep your money in the market, the more money you're going to make. Ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is ""NEVER"". In a sense, they are right. If you put $250,000 in an index fund right now, you'll probably have over a million dollars in thirty or forty years. But here's the problem: Do you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich? Hell no! You want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It's hard to make use of your fortune when you're seventy years old in a wheelchair. If you could make a million dollars in the next few years, what would you do with it? Where would you travel? What kind of car would you buy? The fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich. If your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility is your ally, and stability your enemy. You want to see those large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed by the four hundred point crash a week later. You don't care if the market went up or down 20% this year as long it was UNSTABLE. That's how you're going to make the money. What I'm talking about here is day trading. My father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks and he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years he makes money. The day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a $25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade. He acts quickly, taking advantage of all the information at his disposal about a certain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or down within hours, sometimes within minutes. I can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing amounts of money at it. It's not rocket science, and you only need to learn a few basic principles to get started. Society would have you believe that successful trading is complicated and requires formal training. The truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment strategies to make money. Popular media and investment professionals portray successful trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing ring. They don't want the competetion - and they sure as hell don't want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm to execute a trade for which they'd charge you forty or fifty dollars. They make their money only if you believe two lies: 1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average person. 2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks per trade. Here is what the financial gurus in today's society absolutely, positively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ... The strategies for profitable day trading are in fact so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend a few hours of studying. After reading over 200 financial books and publications during the past decade, and after using day trading to successfully make more than four million dollars in the stock market, I've learned the following lessons: ** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple. ** Anyone can do it. ** It only takes a few hours to learn. When I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn't become wealthy overnight. If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. Buy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The only way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through hard work, knowledge, and determination. After learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started practicing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks brought modest gains. The next few months gave me the practical experience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling close to a six figure income. In less than three years with no formal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk, I had made my first million. The knowledge that I gained during those formative trading years I am willing to share with you in my new book, the Master Trader. You will learn from my mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple, secret formula for day trading that I've used profitably year after year. The income of the day trader can be staggering. Thousands, even hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within minutes. The difference between making money and losing your shirt is simply this: knowledge. I will provide that knowledge, and I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. Average Income of a Day Trader: 5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year 22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year 35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. 27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year 11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year After reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely profitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you win DESPITE the current market weakness. Here is just a snippet of what I will teach you: *** Make money whether a stock goes up or down. *** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds. *** Learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to buy them and the exact price to sell them. *** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the mistakes beginners make. *** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money consistently in every market! *** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance for great success. *** Profit on huge intraday price swings. *** Make money on the biggest news stories. *** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum returns. *** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street professionals use. *** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind. It's time to ask yourself: ""Am I going to listen to the Professionals who say BUY BUY BUY but never sell? Or am I going to take control of my own financial future, and start making money RIGHT NOW in the stock market?"" Who is looking out for your best economic interests - some wealthy Wall Street stockbroker, or yourself? With the Master Trader e-book, you will learn everything you need to know in order to get started with Day Trading ... from choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional trading strategies that make professional traders millions of dollars. The Master Trader e-book is the most comprehensive yet easy to understand and straight-forward book ever written about active trading. If you are serious about success in short term stock trading - ORDER TODAY and start paving the road to your own financial future. Oh, and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade? His high school friends laughed when he said he was going to make money in the stock market. Six years later, he bought a beach-front home on the California coast - WITH CASH. Oops, they weren't laughing anymore. In a rollercoaster market like we have today, day trading is the fastest track to wealth. If you're looking for a long-term retirement investment with no risk that goes up 5% a year, then by all means, this ain't your kind of game. But if you want the QUICKEST possible way to make a FORTUNE in the market, with the lowest element of risk, then order the MASTER TRADER e-book right now. I promise to teach you ALL of the secrets that helped me become a millionaire through successful day trading. You don't need to know anything about the market, and anyone can do it, with minimum effort. It's an easy game to win if you know how the pieces move.

"Dear Sir, I am Dr James Alabi, the chairman of contract award and review committee set up by the federal government of Nigeria under the new civilian dispensation to award new contracts and review existing ones. I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account. There were series of contracts executed by a consortium of multi-nationals in the oil industry in favor of N.N.P.C. The original values of these contracts were deliberately over invoiced to the sum of US$12,320,000.00 (Twelve Million Three Hundred and Twenty Thousand United State Dollars). This amount has now been approved and is now ready to be transferred being that the companies that actually executed these contracts have been fully Paid and the projects officially commissioned. Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount to your account for subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau (civil service law) from operating and/or opening foreign accounts in our names. Needless to say, the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous, in return, we have agreed to offer you 20% of the transferred sum, while 10% shall be set aside for incidental expenses (internal and external) between both parties in the course of the transaction you will be mandated to remit the balance to other accounts in due course. Modalities have been worked out at the highest level of the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the funds within 7 working days subject to your satisfaction of the above stated terms. Our assurance is that your role is risk free. To accord this transaction the legality it deserves and for mutual security of the funds the whole approval procedures will officially and legally processed with your name or the name of any company you may nominate as the bonefide beneficiary. Once more I want you to understand that having put in over twenty-five years in the civil service of my country, I am averse to having my image and career dented. This matter should therefore be treated with utmost secrecy and urgency it deserves. Please you should signify your intention to assist by sending me a reply to this email to state your position on this transaction, if favorable we will take further steps to brief you the full details of this viable transaction. I want to assure you that this business proposal is 100% risk free as we have done our homework properly. I quite believe that you will protect our interest by taking this deal strictly confidential, as we are still in government service, which we intend to retire from in full honor. Kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to enable us include this transfer in the next batch which would constitute the new quarter payments for the 2002 financial year. Thank you and God bless. Dr James Alabi",spam

"UNCOMMON EXOTIC PLEASURE BOTANICALS! Feeling marvelous, Mood-Sensitive, Mood-Enhancing, Depressive/Regressive, ""Sweet Treat"" forumulations for the Pleasuring and Well-Being of Body, Mind & Spirit from the planet's foremost ""Sensitive"" ethnobotanical cooperative -- Exotic Botanical Resources! (Product descriptions, pricing and deep-discounted Intro Offers information below.) SEVENTH HEAVEN ""SWEET TREAT"" MENU 1. SHANGRILA ZOWIE WOWIE (tm) (Gnarly Sweet Grass). Absolutely, the most significant legal ""Personal Choice"" non-cannabis, non-marijuana, non-tobacco smoking botanical on the planet. 2.

GENTLE FEROCITY (tm) Viripotent Energization, Appetite Suppression Tablets without the inclusion of Caffeine or MaHaung Herb or Ephedrine! 6. CAPILLARIS HERBA (tm) A sedate smoking and/or brewing Happiness Botanical. ******************************** **Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm)** ******************************** ""Personal Choice"" Primo Exotic Supplemental Smoking Botanical / Gnarly ""SweetGrass"" Variety / Supplemental Agenda ""Seventh Heaven"" Paradoxical Configuration for the ""significant"" Enhancement and Pleasuring of body, mind & spirit ""sensitivities"" -- Potentiated; Gnarly, whole-plant Matrix -- Paragonic Reserve; Enigmatic Blendage Mood ""Sensitive / Responsive"" Smoking / Brewing Herba. Actions & indications: Simultaneous, High-Spirited; ""Stimulation / Relaxation / Aphrodisia"" (Significant Paradise Consequence!) This is the Personal Choice, Sensitive, Responsive Smoking (""Smoka"") product we have wanting to offer! This is the product and the VALUE that you have been searching for. This is the product that you will buy again & again! We have been in the business (science) of developing non-cannabis, personal choice sensitive smoking agendas for a good, goodly while. Along this avenue of ethnobotany, we have always strived to achieve greater and greater ""Sensitivity / Responsiveness"" & Aphrodisia within our gourmet smokables and brews. And indeed, we have. Many of these previous products are still marketed today by companies who are less developmental than our botanical resource cooperative. Even our own two signature ""smokables"" (Ragga Dagga & Stoney Mahoney) are being discontinued. That Shangrila Zowie Wowie is by far such a superior product is undeniable, therefore it makes no sense to us at all to offer any other smoking product. Quite simply we have surpassed even our own expectations of excellence, thereby; our definition of excellence has evolved. This ""Shangrila"" project has been in research and development for sometime on two fronts. First, on an agricultural level, fields for our Gnarly SweetGrass! must be planted and be allowed to propagate for several years before initial harvest can even be undertaken. This is how the botanical achieves ""potent significance"" much like the regimen of ginseng. Also, harvest time is limited and can take place only twice a year, as like the hemp plant, maximum potency is only achieved after ""flowering"" occurs. But, unlike the hemp plant, and for that matter, unlike most herbs, the entire base plant of Shangrila Zowie Wowie (leave, stem & root) is all ""viripotent,"" which makes this ""gnarly stoke"" a botanical phenomenon! As well, most potentiating factors of Shangrila, as well as the primary botanical factor of Shangrila, will not achieve ""viripotency"" if grown in our hemisphere, therefore; Shangrila is indeed a multi-national, multi-complicated, agricultural undertaking. However, all of this undertaking has indeed been worthwhile! Secondly, the potentiating, infusion regimen used to enhance the attributes of Shangrila has also taken a lon! g time to bring into potent fruition as there are many balancings of the various molecular factors involved in the completion of Zowie Wowie. We are most pleased to be able to say, as you will note in the experience of Shangrila Zowie Wowie, that this process has achieved fruition. Suffice to say, without any hype or glype, Shangrila Zowie Wowie Gnarly SweetGrass is without a doubt, the most significant, non-invasive, non-cannabis, ""sensitive/responsive"", personal choice, absolutely legal (cannot fail a drug test), smoking (""Smoka"") botanical on our planet ... probably in the universe! Hard to believe that this product is ABSOLUTELY LEGAL! * Mill-stoned & honed. * Depressive regressive! * Psychologically uplifting! * Good-bye stress, anxiety & restlessness! * Sophisticated, well-balanced ""ambiance."" * Inspires contemplativeness and creativity. * ""Potentiated"" & viripotent! * 4 – 5 draws lasts a good, goodly while. * Sweet aphrodisia! (Horny Goat Weed factoring) * Simultaneously; uplifting and relaxing! * Easy ignition, Smooth draw, Sweet, heady taste. * Easy on, easy off! * SATISFACTION GUARANTEED! * No ""munchie"" factor. * No failed drug tests! Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) Gnarly ""SweetGrass"" botanical is best utilized as a viri-potent ""Smoka"", via an herb-pipe. As is an herbalist's way, four or five draws of ""Smoka"" should be inhaled and retained. For the non-smoker, it is most appropriate to engage this herbaceousness as a potentiated tea/brew. (Steep approximately one teaspoon of Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) herba per one cup of water for ten minutes or so & strain.) When smoking Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm), please draw gently as it is a most preeminent ""Sensitive / Responsive"" Smoke. Both a personal water-pipe (huuka) (water-pipe is included with quarter pound can only) and a standard herb-pipe are included for your smoking convenience and delight. Smoke and Brew concurrently is absolutely a Sweet, Sensitive Treat! Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) ""Sensitive/Responsive"" Smoka includes and is potentiated with the following non-irradiated, Mill-Stoned & Honed, exotica botanicals and botanical essences: Half-edged Lily-rare Bian Lian (lobeline factors), Kona Lactuca virosa, Yucatan Turnera aphrodisaca, Hawaiian Vervain (Maui strain), Siberian Leonorus Sibricus, rare Lotus Leaf, Jamaican Blue Verbena officinalis, Spanish Peumus Crocus Sativa, Chinese (flowering-tops only) Horny Goat Weed, Ginko Biloba, African Cola Vera, and African Wilde Dagga (flowering-tops only). Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) does not include any tobacco or any cannabis factors. Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) does indeed achieve gourmet distinction upon its own merit. Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) is not intended for use during work or while driving. Nor should it be enjoyed during pregnancy. In addition, although no factor in Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) is illegal or regulated, it is the ethical policy of Exotic Botanical Resources that Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) not be sold or offered to any person that has not attained at least 21 years of age. All things in their time.... ******************************************************** SHANGRILA ZOWIE WOWIE PRICING: * One 1 oz. bag (incl. herb-pipe only) $80.00 (plus shipping) * One 4 oz. Q.P.C.

(See Intro Offers at bottom of this text for further savings) ****************** **PROSAKA (tm)** ****************** High-Ratio extracts in tablet form for Calm, Balance, Serenity & Peaceful living. This Prosaka formulation, which we have just recently further potentiated, boasts an extremely loyal and abundant patronage, having been available to market at large now for a number of years. Prosaka botanical tablets were originally introduced as a botanical, supplemental alternative to various traditional medications that are prescribed for stress, anxiety, depressiveness, mood enhancement, insomnia, excessive dream activity, etc. We like to use this analogy: Imagine the circumstances of your life to be hurricane-ish. Certainly, Prosaka will not stop the wind from blowing. However, it will help to center you within the calm eye of your hurricane, so that you will better see your living and make your decisions from a calmer, more serene, more balanced perspective. Please note that when undertaking any supplemental herbal regimen in this arena, it is important to make a personal commitment to the therapy. It would make no sense to purchase Prosaka and to take it only sporadic! ally or only briefly. It is for this reason, although Prosaka is a very expensive formulation to produce; that we offer 300 count containers at as much of a reduced price as we are able to offer. Prosaka is an exclusive, proprietary amalgamation in tablet form which includes the following uncommon botanicals, extracts, flower-top essences and essential oils: Radix Salviae, Sensitive Mimosa Bark, Arillus Euphoriae, Shizandra, Frutcus Mori, Caulis Polygoni, Zizyohus, Tang Kuei, Cedar Seed, Sweetflag Rhizome, Cuscutae, Amber, Radix Scutellariae, Evodia, Longan, Arisaema, Cistanches, Radix Polygalae, Red Sage Root and Eucommia. No factor contained within Prosaka is restricted or regulated by law. All botanicals contained within are non-irradiated and are of pharmaceutical grade. Suggested Usage: 1 - 2 tablets; 2 to 3 times per day as needed. Best taken on an empty stomach. (During times of intensity up to 10 tablets per day may be utilized.) Also Note: Prosaka is not intended to supercede physician's care nor is it intended for use during pregnancy. ******************************************************** PROSAKA PRICING: * One 100 count bag ... $55.00 plus shipping * One 300 count container ... $130.00 plus shipping For larger quantities, please inquire.

""Secret Fire"" from a toke-smoke point of view, if you know what I mean and be groovin' the scene. Who du the Kathmandu? Now, everybody can du the Kathmandu!

Aqueous Kathmandu is absolutely legal and does not contain any controlled, considered to be harmful or regulated herbs or cannabis/marijuana factors! As ""smoking"" has become so socially taboo over the years and as so many people have asked us for a liquid product, we have long strived to bring a quantum-factored, concentrated liquid product to fruition. This has been no easy task for a variety of botanical and technological reasons. Finally, we are able to say that this task has been accomplished.
